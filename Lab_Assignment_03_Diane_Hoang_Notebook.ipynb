        "This lab assignment will introduce you to some of the clustering methods that we can use to automatically identify documents and terms (words) that are similar to each other. It is important to understand that these are **unsupervised** methods -- our Python program will learn to identify similar documents and terms **on its own** without being provided with any guidance about how well it is performing. These techniques can be very useful for identifying latent similarities and differences among a large collection of documents, and for automatically classifying those documents into groups based on how similar they are to each other.\n",

Approximately 25 miles (40 km) long, it connects the city of Seattle to the northeastern suburbs of Kenmore, Bothell, Woodinville, and Monroe. Its western half is primarily an arterial street, named Lake City Way and Bothell Way, that follows the northern shore of Lake Washington; the eastern half is a grade-separated freeway that runs between Woodinville and Monroe. SR 522 connects several of the metropolitan area's major highways, including Interstate 5 (I-5), I-405, SR 9, and U.S. Route 2 (US 2).\\nThe present-day route of SR 522 was built in stages between 1907 and 1965, beginning with the Red Brick Road from Seattle to Bothell, then part of the Pacific Highway and later US 99. The road later became a branch of Primary State Highway 2 (PSH 2) in 1937, and was extended east to Redmond and North Bend. A branch of the Stevens Pass Highway was built to connect PSH 2 in Bothell and Monroe in 1965, and was incorporated into SR 202 after it was designated in 1964. The Bothell\\u2013Monroe highway was re-designated as part of SR 522 in 1970, leaving SR 202 on the Bothell\\u2013North Bend highway.\\nSince the late 1990s, the SR 522 corridor between Woodinville and Monroe has been partially converted to a freeway to address safety concerns and a growing population. Portions of the highway near Woodinville and Monroe were widened between 2001 and 2014, while other sections near Maltby remain two lanes wide and undivided, with improvement projects left unfunded.\\n\\n\\n== Route description ==\\n\\nSR 522, named Lake City Way within Seattle city limits, begins at an interchange with I-5 in the Roosevelt neighborhood of northern Seattle, east of Green Lake. The interchange only allows movements south towards Downtown Seattle on I-5, and includes a connection to the freeway's reversible express lane system. The highway travels northeast from the interchange, tunneling under the intersection of Roosevelt Way NE and NE 75th Street; the intersection itself is connected to SR 522 by a series of ramps to collector streets. Lake City Way continues northeast through Maple Leaf as a four-lane arterial street before turning north on its approach to Thornton Creek. After crossing the creek, the highway enters the Lake City neighborhood, passing several car dealerships. Lake City itself is a designated urban village, with mixed-use development and apartment buildings that are centered around the intersection of Lake City Way between NE 125th Street and NE 145th Street. At NE 145th Street, SR 522 intersects SR 523 and crosses into Lake Forest Park.Beyond Seattle, the highway is named Bothell Way and follows the northern shore of Lake Washington. SR 522 intersects Ballinger Way (SR 104) at the central shopping center in Lake Forest Park, and is joined by the Burke-Gilman Trail, a multi-use trail running along the lakefront on a former railroad grade. Bothell Way continues east along the northern shore of Lake Washington through the city of Kenmore, located on the mouth of the Sammamish River and home to the Kenmore Air Harbor seaplane base. SR 522 travels upriver through a narrow valley that makes a sharp turn north towards Bothell. The highway turns east and continues downhill of the city's downtown business district, staying near the Sammamish River (and the Sammamish River Trail) and intersecting Bothell Way (formerly SR 527). Leaving Bothell, SR 522 then travels around the southern edge of University of Washington Bothell campus and intersects I-405, becoming a grade-separated freeway.East of I-405, SR 522 enters Woodinville and follows Little Bear Creek as it turns north away from the city's downtown, intersecting SR 202. The freeway enters Snohomish County and intersects SR 9 south of the Brightwater sewage treatment plant. It continues through several sharp turns that follow the Eastside Rail Corridor, a former railroad grade that runs northeasterly through the predominantly rural area near Grace. In Maltby, the freeway reaches an at-grade intersection with Paradise Lake Road (SR 524) and becomes a two-lane undivided highway. SR 522 travels northeast from Maltby, intersecting Echo Lake Road in a single-point urban interchange, and crosses the Snohomish River into Monroe. Within Monroe, the highway widens to a four-lane freeway with median separation and intersects Main Street in a dogbone interchange near the Monroe Correctional Complex. SR 522 cuts across suburban housing areas in Monroe, and crosses over US 2 and the BNSF Railway near the Evergreen State Fairgrounds. The highway makes a 180-degree turn south to intersect with US 2, where it terminates; the intersection also has a direct offramp for eastbound traffic from SR 522 to eastbound US 2.The entire route of SR 522 is designated as part of the National Highway System, classifying it as important to the national economy, defense, and mobility. The State of Washington also designates the SR 522 corridor as a Highway of Statewide Significance, which includes highways that connect major communities throughout the state. The highway is the primary route for Seattle-area residents to access Stevens Pass and other parts of the Cascade Mountains. SR 522 is maintained by the Washington State Department of Transportation (WSDOT), which conducts an annual survey on the state's highways to measure traffic volume in terms of average annual daily traffic. In 2016, WSDOT calculated that 96,000 vehicles used SR 522 at its interchange with I-405 and 12,000 vehicles used it at its eastern terminus in Monroe, the highest and lowest counts along the highway, respectively.\\n\\n\\n== History ==\\n\\n\\n=== Red Brick Road ===\\n\\nLogging settlements were established on the northern shore of Lake Washington in the 1860s and 1870s, relying primarily on the water for intercity transportation. The Seattle, Lake Shore and Eastern Railway was built along the lakefront in 1888, connecting Seattle to the new towns of Bothell and Kenmore. By the 1890s, unpaved logging trails had been completed along Lake Washington and the railroad, reaching as far northeast as Maltby.Bothell businessman and good roads advocate Gerhard Ericksen successfully lobbied the Washington State Legislature to fund the construction of a road from Seattle to Bothell as a State Aid Road and Permanent Highway in 1903. The first section of the highway, traveling 7 miles (11.3 km) from Ravenna Park in Seattle to Lake Forest Park, was completed in 1907 and was pronounced by The Seattle Times as one of the \\\"finest pieces of road to be found anywhere in the United States\\\". From 1911 to 1913, the state and county government paved 4 miles (6.4 km) of the highway between Lake Forest Park and Bothell with bricks. The highway, named the Ericksen Road after its promoter and Bothell Road after the city of Bothell, was opened on January 10, 1914, in an event named the \\\"Boulevard Blowout\\\" that featured 50 automobiles traversing the entire route between Seattle and Bothell. Most of the brick road was replaced in 1934, but a section south of downtown Bothell was preserved and remains known as Red Brick Road Park.\\n\\n\\n=== Federal and state highways ===\\n\\nThe Bothell Road became part of the Pacific Highway in 1915, forming part of the highway that would continue north from Bothell towards Everett. In 1922, the original road alignment through modern-day Lake City was bypassed by the new, concrete-paved Victory Way, dedicated in the memory of World War I veterans. The Pacific Highway was incorporated into a new national highway system that was approved by the American Association of State Highway Officials on November 11, 1926, and numbered as US 99. On October 15, 1927, the North Trunk Highway was opened between Seattle and Everett, providing a shorter and more direct route that would later be designated as US 99 and the Pacific Highway. The Bothell Highway was renovated from Seattle to Lake Forest Park in 1939, including a widening to four lanes and straightening of some segments. Part of the highway in Seattle city limits was renamed to Lake City Way in 1967, after lobbying from Lake City businessmen.An unpaved extension of the Bothell Road, traveling along the Sammamish River to Woodinville, Redmond, and Fall City, was designated as a branch of the Sunset Highway (State Road 2) in 1925. The highway was later paved and incorporated into a longer branch of the Sunset Highway (re-designated as Primary State Highway 2) in 1937, running from Downtown Seattle to Fall City. The branch highway was extended to North Bend after the opening of a Sunset Highway bypass in 1941, using the former mainline road.Another branch of the Bothell Road, from Bothell to the Stevens Pass Highway (Primary State Highway 15) in Monroe, was proposed by the state good roads association in the late 1930s. In 1941, funding for this segment was rejected by the state senate, in favor of completing the highway between Everett and Monroe first. The Bothell\\u2013Monroe Cutoff was designated as a branch of Primary State Highway 15 in 1943, with a provision that the highway would be constructed after the completion of the Everett\\u2013Monroe route. The King County government also unsuccessfully lobbied in the early 1950s for a 23-mile (37 km) highway connecting Duvall to Skykomish along the Tolt River as an alternative to the Monroe cutoff. Construction of the highway was pushed back to 1961, and it was further delayed by rainy weather. The 8.2-mile-long (13.2 km) Bothell\\u2013Monroe Cutoff opened on February 10, 1965, costing $5.3 million (equivalent to $33 million in 2019 dollars) and cutting 20 minutes in travel time between Seattle and the Stevens Pass ski area.In 1963, the Washington State Legislature commissioned a new state highway numbering system to ease confusion over similarly-numbered routes. The new system debuted in 1964, initially with State Route 522 (SR 522) assigned to the branch of Primary State Highway 2 from Seattle to North Bend, and State Route 202 (SR 202) assigned to the branch of Primary State Highway 15 from Woodinville to Monroe. By 1970, SR 522 had been moved to the Bothell\\u2013Monroe Cutoff, while SR 202 was moved to the Woodinville\\u2013North Bend highway.\\n\\n\\n=== Freeway expansion and safety improvements ===\\nThe North Seattle section of the Everett\\u2013Seattle Freeway (now I-5) opened on August 28, 1963, including access to Bothell Way in the Roosevelt neighborhood. SR 522 was truncated to I-5, removing Roosevelt Way and Eastlake Avenue from the state highway system. A four-level freeway interchange with I-405 east of Bothell was completed in 1969, creating a connection between SR 522 and SR 202.In 1968, the state highway department proposed the conversion of SR 522 into a freeway bypassing Lake City Way and Bothell Way. The plan drew heavy opposition from local residents, who feared bottlenecks and a reduction in quality of life, and was removed from regional freeway plans in 1973. Freeway plans in Monroe moved forward instead, with the completion of a two-mile-long (3.2 km) bypass to the west of downtown in 1972. SR 522 was moved from its routing on Main Street to the new freeway, which terminated at US 2 and removed a railroad grade crossing from the route.Since the 1980s, population growth in Monroe and around the SR 522 has resulted in increased traffic congestion and safety issues, including a rise in accidents and crashes. The highway was originally designed for eventual conversion into a four-lane freeway, with leftover right-of-way and bridge approaches built in 1965. Between 1980 and 1995, the 10.5-mile-long (16.9 km) stretch of SR 522 between Woodinville and Monroe was the site of over 1,100 accidents and 40 deaths. SR 522 has been named as one of the most dangerous highways in the United States by Reader's Digest in 1995 and Forbes in 2007, among other lists. The rock band \\\"State Route 522\\\" formed in 1995 by local indie rock musician Jake Snider was named for the highway.In response to the crashes on SR 522, local residents organized a grassroots campaign (\\\"Citizens Rallying for a Safer Highway\\\") to petition the state for safety improvements and a highway widening. In 1993, the state legislature allocated $180 million (equivalent to $293 million in 2019 dollars) in funding towards a five-stage widening project, but the funds were transferred to the general fund at the behest of Governor Mike Lowry. The 1994 supplemental transportation budget included $2 million for engineering studies on SR 522, with construction of a four-lane freeway funded through other means. State lawmakers recommended tolling SR 522 to pay off construction bonds, but the plan was pulled back after opposition from local residents.Existing state funds were used for the first stages of the SR 522 corridor project, including the addition of median rumble strips and improved pavement markers in 1995, which helped reduce head-on collisions. The city of Monroe replaced the eastern half of SR 522 interchange with Main Street (164th Street Southeast) with a roundabout, the first to be built in Snohomish County, in 2001. The first stage of the corridor project was completed in 2001 and widened a section between SR 9 and Paradise Lake Road (SR 524) in Maltby, at a cost of $22 million. The second stage, a new single-point urban interchange at Echo Lake Road southwest of Monroe, was completed in 2006 at a cost of $37 million. The third stage of the SR 522 corridor project was completed in 2014, widening the highway to four lanes across the Snohomish River and through Monroe to US 2, where a new eastbound offramp was also constructed separately in 2012. A new roundabout at the 164th Street Southeast interchange was also opened as part of the project, completing the dogbone interchange.The remaining stages of the SR 522 corridor project between Maltby and the Snohomish River were planned to be funded by the Roads and Transit ballot measure in 2007, before it was rejected by local voters. The 2015 state transportation package included $10 million in design funding for an interchange at Paradise Lake Road in Maltby, to be made available in 2025, but construction of the interchange and widening of the remaining segment remains unfunded. The preliminary design options for the future diamond interchange would place the main ramps at either SR 524 or Paradise Lake Road. A coalition of politician and business leaders named \\\"Finish522\\\" was formed in 2018 to lobby the state government for barriers and complete grade separation in the wake of several fatal crashes in the mid-2010s. Long-term plans from WSDOT to address increasing traffic congestion in downtown Monroe include the construction of a highway bypass for US 2 to the north of the city. The project would include a northern extension of SR 522 to intersect the realigned US 2 near Kelsey Street and Chain Lake Road.\\n\\n\\n=== Mass transit ===\\n\\nThe western portion of SR 522, including Lake City Way and Bothell Way, is a major public transit corridor for the region and is served by Sound Transit Express and King County Metro bus routes. Bus lanes were added to sections of SR 522 in Seattle, Lake Forest Park, and Kenmore in the 1990s, and were expanded in the 2000s. In 2002, Sound Transit launched express Route 522, traveling between Downtown Seattle and Woodinville.Sound Transit plans to run a Stride bus rapid transit line on SR 522 from NE 145th Street to the University of Washington Bothell campus as part of its Sound Transit 3 program, approved in 2016. The line is scheduled to begin service in 2024 and will terminate at the NE 145th Street light rail station in Shoreline. The corridor has also been proposed for forms of rail transit since the mid-20th century, including the failed Forward Thrust ballot measures of 1968 and 1970, the Seattle Monorail Project, and light rail in the Sound Transit long-range plan.\\n\\n\\n== Major intersections ==\\nAll exits are unnumbered.\\n\\n\\n== References ==\\n\\n\\n== External links ==\\n\\n Media related to Washington State Route 522 at Wikimedia Commons\\nHighways of Washington State\",\n          \"The periodicity of solar eclipses is the interval between any two solar eclipses in succession, which will be either 1, 5, or 6 synodic months. It is calculated that the earth will experience a total number of 11,898 solar eclipses between 2000 BCE and 3000 CE. A particular solar eclipse will be repeated approximately after every 18 years 11 days and 8 hours (6,585.32 days) of period, but not in the same geographical region.\\nA particular geographical region will experience a particular solar eclipse in every 54 years 34 days period. Total solar eclipses are rare events, although they occur somewhere on Earth every 18 months on average,\\n\\n\\n== Repetition of solar eclipses ==\\nFor the repetition of a solar eclipse, the geometric alignment of the Earth, Moon and Sun, as well as some parameters of the lunar orbit should be repeated. The following parameters and criteria must be repeated for the repetition of a solar eclipse:\\nThe Moon must be in new phase.\\nThe longitude of perigee of the Moon must be the same.\\nThe longitude of the ascending node must be the same.\\nThe Earth will be nearly the same distance from the Sun, and tilted to it in nearly the same orientation.These conditions are related with the three periods of the Moon's orbital motion, viz. the synodic month, anomalistic month and draconic month. In other words, a particular eclipse will be repeated only if the Moon will complete roughly an integer number of synodic, draconic, and anomalistic periods (223, 242, and 239) and the Earth-Sun-Moon geometry will be nearly identical to that eclipse. The Moon will be at the same node and the same distance from the Earth. Gamma changes monotonically throughout any single Saros series. The change in gamma is larger when Earth is near its aphelion (June to July) than when it is near perihelion (December to January). When the Earth is near its average distance (March to April or September to October), the change in gamma is average. The first three conditions can be met after a time equal to the integral multiple of synodic, draconic, and anomalistic periods. The period is approximately equal to 6,585.32 days (18 years 11 days 8 hours).\\n\\n\\n== Eclipses would not occur in every month ==\\n\\nIf the Earth had a perfectly circular orbit centered around the Sun, and the Moon's orbit was also perfectly circular and centered around the Earth, and both orbits were coplanar (on the same plane) with each other, then two eclipses would happen every lunar month (29.53 days). A lunar eclipse would occur at every full moon, a solar eclipse every new moon, and all solar eclipses would be the same type. In fact the distances between the Earth and Moon and that of the Earth and the Sun vary because both the Earth and the Moon have elliptic orbits. Also, both the orbits are not on the same plane. The Moon's orbit is inclined about 5.14\\u00b0 to Earth's orbit around the Sun. So the Moon's orbit crosses the ecliptic at two points or nodes. If a New Moon takes place within about 17\\u00b0 of a node, then a solar eclipse will be visible from some location on Earth.At an average angular velocity of 0.99\\u00b0 per day, the Sun takes 34.5 days to cross the 34\\u00b0 wide eclipse zone centered on each node. Because the Moon's orbit with respect to the Sun has a mean duration of 29.53 days, there will always be one and possibly two solar eclipses during each 34.5-day interval when the Sun passes through the nodal eclipse zones. These time periods are called eclipse seasons. Either two or three eclipses happen each eclipse season. During the eclipse season, the inclination of the Moon's orbit is low, hence the Sun, Moon, and Earth become aligned straight enough (in syzygy) for an eclipse to occur.\\n\\n\\n== References ==\",\n          \"The Tocharian (sometimes Tokharian) languages ( or ), also known as Ar\\u015bi-Ku\\u010di, Agnean-Kuchean or Kuchean-Agnean, are an extinct branch of the Indo-European language family spoken by inhabitants of the Tarim Basin, the Tocharians.

The discovery of this language family in the early 20th century contradicted the formerly prevalent idea of an east\\u2013west division of the Indo-European language family on the centum\\u2013satem isogloss, and prompted reinvigorated study of the family. Mistakenly identifying the authors with the Tokharoi people of ancient Bactria (Tokharistan), early authors called these languages \\\"Tocharian\\\". This naming has remained, although the names Agnean and Kuchean have been proposed as a replacement.The documents record two closely related languages, called Tocharian A (also East Tocharian, Agnean or Turfanian) and Tocharian B (West Tocharian or Kuchean). The subject matter of the texts suggests that Tocharian A was more archaic and used as a Buddhist liturgical language, while Tocharian B was more actively spoken in the entire area from Turfan in the east to Tumshuq in the west. A body of loanwords and names found in Prakrit documents from the Lop Nor basin have been dubbed Tocharian C (Kror\\u00e4nian). A claimed find of ten Tocharian C texts written in Kharo\\u1e63\\u1e6dh\\u012b script has been discredited.The oldest extant manuscripts in Tocharian B are now dated to the 5th or even late 4th century AD, making Tocharian a language of Late Antiquity contemporary with Gothic, Classical Armenian and Primitive Irish.\\n\\n\\n== Discovery and significance ==\\n\\nThe existence of the Tocharian languages and alphabet was not even suspected until archaeological exploration of the Tarim Basin by Aurel Stein in the early 20th century brought to light fragments of manuscripts in an unknown language, dating from the 6th to 8th centuries AD.It soon became clear that these fragments were actually written in two distinct but related languages belonging to a hitherto unknown branch of Indo-European, now known as Tocharian:\\n\\nTocharian A (Agnean or East Tocharian; natively \\u0101r\\u015bi) of Qara\\u0161\\u00e4h\\u00e4r (ancient Agni, Chinese Yanqi) and Turpan (ancient Turfan and Xo\\u010do), and\\nTocharian B (Kuchean or West Tocharian) of Kucha and Tocharian A sites.\\nPrakrit documents from 3rd-century Kror\\u00e4n and Niya on the southeast edge of the Tarim Basin contain loanwords and names that appear to come from a closely related language, referred to as Tocharian C.The discovery of Tocharian upset some theories about the relations of Indo-European languages and revitalized their study. In the 19th century, it was thought that the division between centum and satem languages was a simple west\\u2013east division, with centum languages in the west. The theory was undermined in the early 20th century by the discovery of Hittite, a centum language in a relatively eastern location, and Tocharian, which was a centum language despite being the easternmost branch. The result was a new hypothesis, following the wave model of Johannes Schmidt, suggesting that the satem isogloss represents a linguistic innovation in the central part of the Proto-Indo-European home range, and the centum languages along the eastern and the western peripheries did not undergo that change.Most scholars reject Walter Bruno Henning's proposed link to Gutian, a language spoken on the Iranian plateau in the 22nd century BC and known only from personal names.Tocharian probably died out after 840 when the Uyghurs, expelled from Mongolia by the Kyrgyz, moved into the Tarim Basin. The theory is supported by the discovery of translations of Tocharian texts into Uyghur.\\nSome modern Chinese words may ultimately derive from a Tocharian or related source, e.g. Old Chinese *mjit (\\u871c; m\\u00ec) \\\"honey\\\", from proto-Tocharian *\\u1e3f\\u0259t(\\u0259) (where *\\u1e3f is palatalized; cf. Tocharian B mit), cognate with English mead.\\n\\n\\n== Names ==\\n\\nA colophon to a Buddhist manuscript in Old Turkish from 800 AD states that it was translated from Sanskrit via a tw\\u03b3ry language.  In 1907, Emil Sieg and Friedrich W. K. M\\u00fcller guessed that this referred to the newly discovered language of the Turpan area.\\nSieg and M\\u00fcller, reading this name as toxr\\u00ef, connected it with the ethnonym T\\u00f3charoi (Ancient Greek: \\u03a4\\u03cc\\u03c7\\u03b1\\u03c1\\u03bf\\u03b9, Ptolemy VI, 11, 6, 2nd century AD), itself taken from Indo-Iranian (cf. Old Persian tux\\u0101ri-, Khotanese ttahv\\u0101ra, and Sanskrit tukh\\u0101ra), and proposed the name \\\"Tocharian\\\" (German Tocharisch).  Ptolemy's T\\u00f3charoi are often associated by modern scholars with the Yuezhi of Chinese historical accounts, who founded the Kushan empire. It is now clear that these people actually spoke Bactrian, an Eastern Iranian language, rather than the language of the Tarim manuscripts, so the term \\\"Tocharian\\\" is considered a misnomer.Nevertheless, it remains the standard term for the language of the Tarim Basin manuscripts.In 1938, Walter Henning found the term \\\"four tw\\u03b3ry\\\" used in early 9th-century manuscripts in Sogdian, Middle Iranian and Uighur.  He argued that it referred to the region on the northeast edge of the Tarim, including Agni and Karakhoja but not Kucha.  He thus inferred that the colophon referred to the Agnean language.Although the term tw\\u03b3ry or toxr\\u00ef appears to be the Old Turkic name for the Tocharians, it is not found in Tocharian texts.\\nThe apparent self-designation \\u0101r\\u015bi appears in Tocharian A texts. Tocharian B texts use the adjective ku\\u015bi\\u00f1\\u00f1e, derived from ku\\u015bi or ku\\u010di, a name also known from Chinese and Turkic documents. The historian Bernard Sergent compounded these names to coin an alternative term Ar\\u015bi-Ku\\u010di for the family, recently revised to Agni-Ku\\u010di, but this name has not achieved widespread usage.\\n\\n\\n== Writing system ==\\n\\nTocharian is documented in manuscript fragments, mostly from the 8th century (with a few earlier ones) that were written on palm leaves, wooden tablets and Chinese paper, preserved by the extremely dry climate of the Tarim Basin. Samples of the language have been discovered at sites in Kucha and Karasahr, including many mural inscriptions.\\nMost of attested Tocharian was written in the Tocharian alphabet, a derivative of the Brahmi alphabetic syllabary (abugida) also referred to as North Turkestan Brahmi or slanting Brahmi. However a smaller amount was written in the Manichaean script in which Manichaean texts were recorded. It soon became apparent that a large proportion of the manuscripts were translations of known Buddhist works in Sanskrit and some of them were even bilingual, facilitating decipherment of the new language. Besides the Buddhist and Manichaean religious texts, there were also monastery correspondence and accounts, commercial documents, caravan permits, medical and magical texts, and one love poem.\\nIn 1998, Chinese linguist Ji Xianlin published a translation and analysis of fragments of a Tocharian Maitreyasamiti-Nataka discovered in 1974 in Yanqi.\\n\\n\\n== Tocharian A and B ==\\n\\nTocharian A and B are significantly different, to the point of being mutually unintelligible.  A common Proto-Tocharian language must precede the attested languages by several centuries, probably dating to the late 1st millennium BC.Tocharian A is found only in the eastern part of the Tocharian-speaking area, and all extant texts are of a religious nature.  Tocharian B, however, is found throughout the range and in both religious and secular texts.  As a result, it has been suggested that Tocharian A was a liturgical language, no longer spoken natively, while Tocharian B was the spoken language of the entire area. On the other hand, it is possible that the lack of a secular corpus in Tocharian A is simply an accident, due to the smaller distribution of the language and the fragmentary preservation of Tocharian texts in general.The hypothesized relationship of Tocharian A and B as liturgical and spoken forms, respectively, is sometimes compared with the relationship between Latin and the modern Romance languages, or Classical Chinese and Mandarin. However, in both of these latter cases the liturgical language is the linguistic ancestor of the spoken language, whereas no such relationship holds between Tocharian A and B.  In fact, from a phonological perspective Tocharian B is significantly more conservative than Tocharian A, and serves as the primary source for reconstructing Proto-Tocharian. Only Tocharian B preserves the following Proto-Tocharian features: stress distinctions, final vowels, diphthongs, and o vs. e distinction. In turn, the loss of final vowels in Tocharian A has led to the loss of certain Proto-Tocharian categories still found in Tocharian B, e.g. the vocative case and some of the noun, verb and adjective declensional classes.\\nIn their declensional and conjugational endings, the two languages innovated in divergent ways, with neither clearly simpler than the other.  For example, both languages show significant innovations in the present active indicative endings but in radically different ways, so that only the second-person singular ending is directly cognate between the two languages, and in most cases neither variant is directly cognate with the corresponding Proto-Indo-European (PIE) form.  The agglutinative secondary case endings in the two languages likewise stem from different sources, showing parallel development of the secondary case system after the Proto-Tocharian period.  Likewise, some of the verb classes show independent origins, e.g. the class II preterite, which uses reduplication in Tocharian A (possibly from the reduplicated aorist) but long PIE \\u0113 in Tocharian B (possibly related to the long-vowel perfect found in Latin l\\u0113g\\u012b, f\\u0113c\\u012b, etc.).Tocharian B shows an internal chronological development; three linguistic stages have been detected. The oldest stage is attested only in Kucha. There are also the middle ('classical\\u02bc), and the late stage.\\n\\n\\n== Tocharian C ==\\nBased on 3rd-century Loulan G\\u0101ndh\\u0101r\\u012b Prakrit documents containing Tocharian loanwords such as kilme 'district', \\u1e63o\\u1e63tha\\u1e43ga 'tax collector', and \\u1e63ilpoga 'document', T. Burrow suggested in the 1930s the existence of a third Tocharian language, which has been labelled Tocharian C or \\\"Kror\\u00e4nian\\\", \\\"Krorainic\\\", or \\\"Lolanisch\\\".In 2018, ten texts written in the Kharo\\u1e63\\u1e6dh\\u012b alphabet from Loulan were published and analyzed in the posthumous papers of Tocharologist Klaus T. Schmidt as being written in Tocharian C.  Schmidt suggested that the language was closer to Tocharian B than to Tocharian A. On September 15 and 16, 2019, a group of linguists led by Georges Pinault and Micha\\u00ebl Peyrot met in Leiden to examine Schmidt's transcriptions and the original texts, and concluded they had all been transcribed entirely incorrectly. Their conclusions appear to have discredited Schmidt's Tocharian C claims.\\n\\n\\n== Phonology ==\\n\\nPhonetically, Tocharian languages are \\\"centum\\\" Indo-European languages, meaning that they merge the palatovelar consonants (*\\u1e31, *\\u01f5, *\\u01f5\\u02b0) of Proto Indo-European with the plain velars (*k, *g, *g\\u02b0) rather than palatalizing them to affricates or sibilants. Centum languages are mostly found in western and southern Europe (Greek, Italic, Celtic, Germanic). In that sense, Tocharian (to some extent like the Greek and the Anatolian languages) seems to have been an isolate in the \\\"satem\\\" (i.e. palatovelar to sibilant) phonetic regions of Indo-European-speaking populations. The discovery of Tocharian contributed to doubts that Proto-Indo-European had originally split into western and eastern branches; today, the centum\\u2013satem division is not seen as a real familial division.\\n\\n\\n=== Vowels ===\\nTocharian A and Tocharian B have the same set of vowels, but they often do not correspond to each other.  For example, the sound a did not occur in Proto-Tocharian. Tocharian B a  is derived from former stressed \\u00e4 or unstressed \\u0101 (reflected unchanged in Tocharian A), while Tocharian A a stems from Proto-Tocharian /\\u025b/ or /\\u0254/ (reflected as /e/ and /o/ in Tocharian B), and Tocharian A e and o stem largely from monophthongization of former diphthongs (still present in Tocharian B).\\n\\n\\n=== Diphthongs ===\\nDiphthongs occur in Tocharian B only.\\n\\n\\n=== Consonants ===\\n\\nThe following table lists the reconstructed phonemes in Tocharian along with their standard transcription.  Because Tocharian is written in an alphabet used originally for Sanskrit and its descendants, the transcription of the sounds is directly based on the transcription of the corresponding Sanskrit sounds.  The Tocharian alphabet also has letters representing all of the remaining Sanskrit sounds, but these appear only in Sanskrit loanwords and are not thought to have had distinct pronunciations in Tocharian.  There is some uncertainty as to actual pronunciation of some of the letters, particularly those representing palatalized obstruents (see below).\\n\\n/n/ is transcribed by two different letters in the Tocharian alphabet depending on position.  Based on the corresponding letters in Sanskrit, these are transcribed \\u1e43 (word-finally, including before certain clitics) and n (elsewhere), but \\u1e43 represents /n/, not /m/.\\nThe sound written c is thought to correspond to a palatal stop /c/ in Sanskrit.  The Tocharian pronunciation /t\\u0255/ is suggested by the common occurrence of the cluster \\u015bc, but the exact pronunciation cannot be determined with certainty.\\nThe sound written \\u1e63 corresponds to retroflex sibilant /\\u0282/ in Sanskrit, but it seems more likely to have been a palato-alveolar sibilant /\\u0283/ (as in English \\\"ship\\\"), because it derives from a palatalized /s/.\\nThe sound \\u1e45 /\\u014b/ occurs only before k, or in some clusters where a k has been deleted between consonants. It is clearly phonemic because sequences nk and \\u00f1k also exist (from syncope of a former \\u00e4 between them).\\n\\n\\n== Morphology ==\\n\\n\\n=== Nouns ===\\nTocharian has completely re-worked the nominal declension system of Proto-Indo-European. The only cases inherited from the proto-language are nominative, genitive, accusative, and (in Tocharian B only) vocative; in Tocharian the old accusative is known as the oblique case. In addition to these primary cases, however, each Tocharian language has six cases formed by the addition of an invariant suffix to the oblique case \\u2014 although the set of six cases is not the same in each language, and the suffixes are largely non-cognate. For example, the Tocharian word yakwe (Toch B), yuk (Toch A) \\\"horse\\\" < PIE *e\\u1e31wos is declined as follows:\\nThe Tocharian A instrumental case rarely occurs with humans.\\nWhen referring to humans, the oblique singular of most adjectives and of some nouns is marked in both varieties by an ending -(a)\\u1e43, which also appears in the secondary cases.  An example is e\\u1e45kwe (Toch B), o\\u1e45k (Toch A) \\\"man\\\", which belongs to the same declension as above, but has oblique singular e\\u1e45kwe\\u1e43 (Toch B), o\\u1e45ka\\u1e43 (Toch A), and corresponding oblique stems e\\u1e45kwe\\u1e43- (Toch B), o\\u1e45kn- (Toch A) for the secondary cases.  This is thought to stem from the generalization of n-stem adjectives as an indication of determinative semantics, seen most prominently in the weak adjective declension in the Germanic languages (where it cooccurs with definite articles and determiners), but also in Latin and Greek n-stem nouns (especially proper names) formed from adjectives, e.g. Latin Cat\\u014d (genitive Cat\\u014dnis) literally \\\"the sly one\\\" < catus \\\"sly\\\", Greek Pl\\u00e1t\\u014dn literally \\\"the broad-shouldered one\\\" < plat\\u00fas \\\"broad\\\".\\n\\n\\n=== Verbs ===\\n\\nIn contrast, the verb verbal conjugation system is quite conservative. The majority of Proto-Indo-European verbal classes and categories are represented in some manner in Tocharian, although not necessarily with the same function. Some examples: athematic and thematic present tenses, including null-, -y-, -s\\u1e31-, -s-, -n- and -nH- suffixes as well as n-infixes and various laryngeal-ending stems; o-grade and possibly lengthened-grade perfects (although lacking reduplication or augment); sigmatic, reduplicated, thematic and possibly lengthened-grade aorists; optatives; imperatives; and possibly PIE subjunctives.\\nIn addition, most PIE sets of endings are found in some form in Tocharian (although with significant innovations), including thematic and athematic endings, primary (non-past) and secondary (past) endings, active and mediopassive endings, and perfect endings.  Dual endings are still found, although they are rarely attested and generally restricted to the third person. The mediopassive still reflects the distinction between primary -r and secondary -i, effaced in most Indo-European languages.  Both root and suffix ablaut is still well-represented, although again with significant innovations.\\n\\n\\n==== Categories ====\\nTocharian verbs are conjugated in the following categories:\\nMood: indicative, subjunctive, optative, imperative.\\nTense/aspect (in the indicative only): present, preterite, imperfect.\\nVoice: active, mediopassive, deponent.\\nPerson: 1st, 2nd, 3rd.\\nNumber: singular, dual, plural.\\nCausation: basic, causative.\\nNon-finite: active participle, mediopassive participle, present gerundive, subjunctive gerundive.\\n\\n\\n==== Classes ====\\nA given verb belongs to one of a large number of classes, according to its conjugation.  As in Sanskrit, Ancient Greek and (to a lesser extent) Latin, there are independent sets of classes in the indicative present, subjunctive, perfect, imperative, and to a limited extent optative and imperfect, and there is no general correspondence among the different sets of classes, meaning that each verb must be specified using a number of principal parts.\\n\\n\\n===== Present indicative =====\\nThe most complex system is the present indicative, consisting of 12 classes, 8 thematic and 4 athematic, with distinct sets of thematic and athematic endings.  The following classes occur in Tocharian B (some are missing in Tocharian A):\\n\\nI: Athematic without suffix < PIE root athematic.\\nII: Thematic without suffix < PIE root thematic.\\nIII: Thematic with PToch suffix *-\\u00eb-. Mediopassive only.  Apparently reflecting consistent PIE o theme rather than the normal alternating o/e theme.\\nIV: Thematic with PToch suffix *-\\u0254-. Mediopassive only.  Same PIE origin as previous class, but diverging within Proto-Tocharian.\\nV: Athematic with PToch suffix *-\\u0101-, likely from either PIE verbs ending in a syllabic laryngeal or PIE derived verbs in *-eh\\u2082- (but extended to other verbs).\\nVI: Athematic with PToch suffix *-n\\u0101-, from PIE verbs in *-nH-.\\nVII: Athematic with infixed nasal, from PIE infixed nasal verbs.\\nVIII: Thematic with suffix -s-, possibly from PIE -s\\u1e31-?\\nIX: Thematic with suffix -sk- < PIE -s\\u1e31-.\\nX: Thematic with PToch suffix *-n\\u00e4sk/n\\u0101sk- (evidently a combination of classes VI and IX).\\nXI: Thematic in PToch suffix *-s\\u00e4sk- (evidently a combination of classes VIII and IX).\\nXII: Thematic with PToch suffix *-(\\u00e4)\\u00f1\\u00f1- < either PIE *-n-y- (denominative to n-stem nouns) or PIE *-nH-y- (deverbative from PIE *-nH- verbs).Palatalization of the final root consonant occurs in the 2nd singular, 3rd singular, 3rd dual and 2nd plural in thematic classes II and VIII-XII as a result of the original PIE thematic vowel e.\\n\\n\\n===== Subjunctive =====\\nThe subjunctive likewise has 12 classes, denoted i through xii.  Most are conjugated identically to the corresponding indicative classes; indicative and subjunctive are distinguished by the fact that a verb in a given indicative class will usually belong to a different subjunctive class.\\nIn addition, four subjunctive classes differ from the corresponding indicative classes, two \\\"special subjunctive\\\" classes with differing suffixes and two \\\"varying subjunctive\\\" classes with root ablaut reflecting the PIE perfect.\\nSpecial subjunctives:\\n\\niv: Thematic with suffix i < PIE -y-, with consistent palatalization of final root consonant.  Tocharian B only, rare.\\nvii: Thematic (not athematic, as in indicative class VII) with suffix \\u00f1 < PIE -n- (palatalized by thematic e, with palatalized variant generalized).Varying subjunctives:\\n\\ni: Athematic without suffix, with root ablaut reflecting PIE o-grade in active singular, zero-grade elsewhere.  Derived from PIE perfect.\\nv: Identical to class i but with PToch suffix *-\\u0101-, originally reflecting laryngeal-final roots but generalized.\\n\\n\\n===== Preterite =====\\nThe preterite has 6 classes:\\n\\nI: The most common class, with a suffix \\u0101 < PIE \\u1e24 (i.e. roots ending in a laryngeal, although widely extended to other roots).  This class shows root ablaut, with original e-grade (and palatalization of the initial root consonant) in the active singular, contrasting with zero-grade (and no palatalization) elsewhere.\\nII: This class has reduplication in Tocharian A (possibly reflecting the PIE reduplicated aorist).  However, Tocharian B has a vowel reflecting long PIE \\u0113, along with palatalization of the initial root consonant.  There is no ablaut in this class.\\nIII: This class has a suffix s in the 3rd singular active and throughout the mediopassive, evidently reflecting the PIE sigmatic aorist.  Root ablaut occurs between active and mediopassive.  A few verbs have palatalization in the active along with s in the 3rd singular, but no palatalization and no s in the mediopassive, along with no root ablaut (the vowel reflects PToch \\u00eb).  This suggests that, for these verbs in particular, the active originates in the PIE sigmatic aorist (with s suffix and \\u0113 vocalism) while the mediopassive stems from the PIE perfect (with o vocalism).\\nIV: This class has suffix \\u1e63\\u1e63\\u0101, with no ablaut.  Most verbs in this class are causatives.\\nV: This class has suffix \\u00f1(\\u00f1)\\u0101, with no ablaut.  Only a few verbs belong to this class.\\nVI: This class, which has only two verbs, is derived from the PIE thematic aorist.  As in Greek, this class has different endings from all the others, which partly reflect the PIE secondary endings (as expected for the thematic aorist).All except preterite class VI have a common set of endings that stem from the PIE perfect endings, although with significant innovations.\\n\\n\\n===== Imperative =====\\nThe imperative likewise shows 6 classes, with a unique set of endings, found only in the second person, and a prefix beginning with p-.  This prefix usually reflects Proto-Tocharian *p\\u00e4- but unexpected connecting vowels occasionally occur, and the prefix combines with vowel-initial and glide-initial roots in unexpected ways.  The prefix is often compared with the Slavic perfective prefix po-, although the phonology is difficult to explain.\\nClasses i through v tend to co-occur with preterite classes I through V, although there are many exceptions.  Class vi is not so much a coherent class as an \\\"irregular\\\" class with all verbs not fitting in other categories.  The imperative classes tend to share the same suffix as the corresponding preterite (if any), but to have root vocalism that matches the vocalism of a verb's subjunctive.  This includes the root ablaut of subjunctive classes i and v, which tend to co-occur with imperative class i.\\n\\n\\n===== Optative and imperfect =====\\nThe optative and imperfect have related formations. The optative is generally built by adding i onto the subjunctive stem.  Tocharian B likewise forms the imperfect by adding i onto the present indicative stem, while Tocharian A has 4 separate imperfect formations: usually \\u0101 is added to the subjunctive stem, but occasionally to the indicative stem, and sometimes either \\u0101 or s is added directly onto the root.  The endings differ between the two languages: Tocharian A uses present endings for the optative and preterite endings for the imperfect, while Tocharian B uses the same endings for both, which are a combination of preterite and unique endings (the latter used in the singular active).\\n\\n\\n==== Endings ====\\nAs suggested by the above discussion, there are a large number of sets of endings.  The present-tense endings come in both thematic and athematic variants, although they are related, with the thematic endings generally reflecting a theme vowel (PIE e or o) plus the athematic endings.  There are different sets for the preterite classes I through V; preterite class VI; the imperative; and in Tocharian B, in the singular active of the optative and imperfect.  Furthermore, each set of endings comes with both active and mediopassive forms.  The mediopassive forms are quite conservative, directly reflecting the PIE variation between -r in the present and -i in the past. (Most other languages with the mediopassive have generalized one of the two.)\\nThe present-tense endings are almost completely divergent between Tocharian A and B.  The following shows the thematic endings, with their origin:\\n\\n\\n== Comparison to other Indo-European languages ==\\n\\nIn traditional Indo-European studies, no hypothesis of a closer genealogical relationship of the Tocharian languages has been widely accepted by linguists. However, lexicostatistical and glottochronological approaches suggest the Anatolian languages, including Hittite, might be the closest relatives of Tocharian.\\nAs an example, the same Proto-Indo-European root *h\\u2082wrg(h)- (but not a common suffixed formation) can be reconstructed to underlie the words for 'wheel': Tocharian A w\\u00e4rk\\u00e4nt, Tokharian B yerkwanto and Hittite \\u1e2b\\u016brkis.\\n\\n\\n== Notable example ==\\nMost of the texts known from the Tocharians are religious, but one noted text is a fragment of a love poem in Tocharian B (manuscript B-496, found in Kizil):\\n\\n\\n== See also ==\\nLanguage families and languages\\nTocharians\\nTocharian and Indo-European Studies (journal)\\n\\n\\n== References ==\\n\\n\\n=== Citations ===\\n\\n\\n=== Sources ===\\n\\n\\n== Further reading ==\\nLubotsky A.M.

Approximately 25 miles (40 km) long, it connects the city of Seattle to the northeastern suburbs of Kenmore, Bothell, Woodinville, and Monroe. Its western half is primarily an arterial street, named Lake City Way and Bothell Way, that follows the northern shore of Lake Washington; the eastern half is a grade-separated freeway that runs between Woodinville and Monroe. SR 522 connects several of the metropolitan area's major highways, including Interstate 5 (I-5), I-405, SR 9, and U.S. Route 2 (US 2).\\nThe present-day route of SR 522 was built in stages between 1907 and 1965, beginning with the Red Brick Road from Seattle to Bothell, then part of the Pacific Highway and later US 99. The road later became a branch of Primary State Highway 2 (PSH 2) in 1937, and was extended east to Redmond and North Bend. A branch of the Stevens Pass Highway was built to connect PSH 2 in Bothell and Monroe in 1965, and was incorporated into SR 202 after it was designated in 1964. The Bothell\\u2013Monroe highway was re-designated as part of SR 522 in 1970, leaving SR 202 on the Bothell\\u2013North Bend highway.\\nSince the late 1990s, the SR 522 corridor between Woodinville and Monroe has been partially converted to a freeway to address safety concerns and a growing population. Portions of the highway near Woodinville and Monroe were widened between 2001 and 2014, while other sections near Maltby remain two lanes wide and undivided, with improvement projects left unfunded.\\n\\n\\n== Route description ==\\n\\nSR 522, named Lake City Way within Seattle city limits, begins at an interchange with I-5 in the Roosevelt neighborhood of northern Seattle, east of Green Lake. The interchange only allows movements south towards Downtown Seattle on I-5, and includes a connection to the freeway's reversible express lane system. The highway travels northeast from the interchange, tunneling under the intersection of Roosevelt Way NE and NE 75th Street; the intersection itself is connected to SR 522 by a series of ramps to collector streets. Lake City Way continues northeast through Maple Leaf as a four-lane arterial street before turning north on its approach to Thornton Creek. After crossing the creek, the highway enters the Lake City neighborhood, passing several car dealerships. Lake City itself is a designated urban village, with mixed-use development and apartment buildings that are centered around the intersection of Lake City Way between NE 125th Street and NE 145th Street. At NE 145th Street, SR 522 intersects SR 523 and crosses into Lake Forest Park.Beyond Seattle, the highway is named Bothell Way and follows the northern shore of Lake Washington. SR 522 intersects Ballinger Way (SR 104) at the central shopping center in Lake Forest Park, and is joined by the Burke-Gilman Trail, a multi-use trail running along the lakefront on a former railroad grade. Bothell Way continues east along the northern shore of Lake Washington through the city of Kenmore, located on the mouth of the Sammamish River and home to the Kenmore Air Harbor seaplane base. SR 522 travels upriver through a narrow valley that makes a sharp turn north towards Bothell. The highway turns east and continues downhill of the city's downtown business district, staying near the Sammamish River (and the Sammamish River Trail) and intersecting Bothell Way (formerly SR 527). Leaving Bothell, SR 522 then travels around the southern edge of University of Washington Bothell campus and intersects I-405, becoming a grade-separated freeway.East of I-405, SR 522 enters Woodinville and follows Little Bear Creek as it turns north away from the city's downtown, intersecting SR 202. The freeway enters Snohomish County and intersects SR 9 south of the Brightwater sewage treatment plant. It continues through several sharp turns that follow the Eastside Rail Corridor, a former railroad grade that runs northeasterly through the predominantly rural area near Grace. In Maltby, the freeway reaches an at-grade intersection with Paradise Lake Road (SR 524) and becomes a two-lane undivided highway. SR 522 travels northeast from Maltby, intersecting Echo Lake Road in a single-point urban interchange, and crosses the Snohomish River into Monroe. Within Monroe, the highway widens to a four-lane freeway with median separation and intersects Main Street in a dogbone interchange near the Monroe Correctional Complex. SR 522 cuts across suburban housing areas in Monroe, and crosses over US 2 and the BNSF Railway near the Evergreen State Fairgrounds. The highway makes a 180-degree turn south to intersect with US 2, where it terminates; the intersection also has a direct offramp for eastbound traffic from SR 522 to eastbound US 2.The entire route of SR 522 is designated as part of the National Highway System, classifying it as important to the national economy, defense, and mobility. The State of Washington also designates the SR 522 corridor as a Highway of Statewide Significance, which includes highways that connect major communities throughout the state. The highway is the primary route for Seattle-area residents to access Stevens Pass and other parts of the Cascade Mountains. SR 522 is maintained by the Washington State Department of Transportation (WSDOT), which conducts an annual survey on the state's highways to measure traffic volume in terms of average annual daily traffic. In 2016, WSDOT calculated that 96,000 vehicles used SR 522 at its interchange with I-405 and 12,000 vehicles used it at its eastern terminus in Monroe, the highest and lowest counts along the highway, respectively.\\n\\n\\n== History ==\\n\\n\\n=== Red Brick Road ===\\n\\nLogging settlements were established on the northern shore of Lake Washington in the 1860s and 1870s, relying primarily on the water for intercity transportation. The Seattle, Lake Shore and Eastern Railway was built along the lakefront in 1888, connecting Seattle to the new towns of Bothell and Kenmore. By the 1890s, unpaved logging trails had been completed along Lake Washington and the railroad, reaching as far northeast as Maltby.Bothell businessman and good roads advocate Gerhard Ericksen successfully lobbied the Washington State Legislature to fund the construction of a road from Seattle to Bothell as a State Aid Road and Permanent Highway in 1903. The first section of the highway, traveling 7 miles (11.3 km) from Ravenna Park in Seattle to Lake Forest Park, was completed in 1907 and was pronounced by The Seattle Times as one of the \\\"finest pieces of road to be found anywhere in the United States\\\". From 1911 to 1913, the state and county government paved 4 miles (6.4 km) of the highway between Lake Forest Park and Bothell with bricks. The highway, named the Ericksen Road after its promoter and Bothell Road after the city of Bothell, was opened on January 10, 1914, in an event named the \\\"Boulevard Blowout\\\" that featured 50 automobiles traversing the entire route between Seattle and Bothell. Most of the brick road was replaced in 1934, but a section south of downtown Bothell was preserved and remains known as Red Brick Road Park.\\n\\n\\n=== Federal and state highways ===\\n\\nThe Bothell Road became part of the Pacific Highway in 1915, forming part of the highway that would continue north from Bothell towards Everett. In 1922, the original road alignment through modern-day Lake City was bypassed by the new, concrete-paved Victory Way, dedicated in the memory of World War I veterans. The Pacific Highway was incorporated into a new national highway system that was approved by the American Association of State Highway Officials on November 11, 1926, and numbered as US 99. On October 15, 1927, the North Trunk Highway was opened between Seattle and Everett, providing a shorter and more direct route that would later be designated as US 99 and the Pacific Highway. The Bothell Highway was renovated from Seattle to Lake Forest Park in 1939, including a widening to four lanes and straightening of some segments. Part of the highway in Seattle city limits was renamed to Lake City Way in 1967, after lobbying from Lake City businessmen.An unpaved extension of the Bothell Road, traveling along the Sammamish River to Woodinville, Redmond, and Fall City, was designated as a branch of the Sunset Highway (State Road 2) in 1925. The highway was later paved and incorporated into a longer branch of the Sunset Highway (re-designated as Primary State Highway 2) in 1937, running from Downtown Seattle to Fall City. The branch highway was extended to North Bend after the opening of a Sunset Highway bypass in 1941, using the former mainline road.Another branch of the Bothell Road, from Bothell to the Stevens Pass Highway (Primary State Highway 15) in Monroe, was proposed by the state good roads association in the late 1930s. In 1941, funding for this segment was rejected by the state senate, in favor of completing the highway between Everett and Monroe first. The Bothell\\u2013Monroe Cutoff was designated as a branch of Primary State Highway 15 in 1943, with a provision that the highway would be constructed after the completion of the Everett\\u2013Monroe route. The King County government also unsuccessfully lobbied in the early 1950s for a 23-mile (37 km) highway connecting Duvall to Skykomish along the Tolt River as an alternative to the Monroe cutoff. Construction of the highway was pushed back to 1961, and it was further delayed by rainy weather. The 8.2-mile-long (13.2 km) Bothell\\u2013Monroe Cutoff opened on February 10, 1965, costing $5.3 million (equivalent to $33 million in 2019 dollars) and cutting 20 minutes in travel time between Seattle and the Stevens Pass ski area.In 1963, the Washington State Legislature commissioned a new state highway numbering system to ease confusion over similarly-numbered routes. The new system debuted in 1964, initially with State Route 522 (SR 522) assigned to the branch of Primary State Highway 2 from Seattle to North Bend, and State Route 202 (SR 202) assigned to the branch of Primary State Highway 15 from Woodinville to Monroe. By 1970, SR 522 had been moved to the Bothell\\u2013Monroe Cutoff, while SR 202 was moved to the Woodinville\\u2013North Bend highway.\\n\\n\\n=== Freeway expansion and safety improvements ===\\nThe North Seattle section of the Everett\\u2013Seattle Freeway (now I-5) opened on August 28, 1963, including access to Bothell Way in the Roosevelt neighborhood. SR 522 was truncated to I-5, removing Roosevelt Way and Eastlake Avenue from the state highway system. A four-level freeway interchange with I-405 east of Bothell was completed in 1969, creating a connection between SR 522 and SR 202.In 1968, the state highway department proposed the conversion of SR 522 into a freeway bypassing Lake City Way and Bothell Way. The plan drew heavy opposition from local residents, who feared bottlenecks and a reduction in quality of life, and was removed from regional freeway plans in 1973. Freeway plans in Monroe moved forward instead, with the completion of a two-mile-long (3.2 km) bypass to the west of downtown in 1972. SR 522 was moved from its routing on Main Street to the new freeway, which terminated at US 2 and removed a railroad grade crossing from the route.Since the 1980s, population growth in Monroe and around the SR 522 has resulted in increased traffic congestion and safety issues, including a rise in accidents and crashes. The highway was originally designed for eventual conversion into a four-lane freeway, with leftover right-of-way and bridge approaches built in 1965. Between 1980 and 1995, the 10.5-mile-long (16.9 km) stretch of SR 522 between Woodinville and Monroe was the site of over 1,100 accidents and 40 deaths. SR 522 has been named as one of the most dangerous highways in the United States by Reader's Digest in 1995 and Forbes in 2007, among other lists. The rock band \\\"State Route 522\\\" formed in 1995 by local indie rock musician Jake Snider was named for the highway.In response to the crashes on SR 522, local residents organized a grassroots campaign (\\\"Citizens Rallying for a Safer Highway\\\") to petition the state for safety improvements and a highway widening. In 1993, the state legislature allocated $180 million (equivalent to $293 million in 2019 dollars) in funding towards a five-stage widening project, but the funds were transferred to the general fund at the behest of Governor Mike Lowry. The 1994 supplemental transportation budget included $2 million for engineering studies on SR 522, with construction of a four-lane freeway funded through other means. State lawmakers recommended tolling SR 522 to pay off construction bonds, but the plan was pulled back after opposition from local residents.Existing state funds were used for the first stages of the SR 522 corridor project, including the addition of median rumble strips and improved pavement markers in 1995, which helped reduce head-on collisions. The city of Monroe replaced the eastern half of SR 522 interchange with Main Street (164th Street Southeast) with a roundabout, the first to be built in Snohomish County, in 2001. The first stage of the corridor project was completed in 2001 and widened a section between SR 9 and Paradise Lake Road (SR 524) in Maltby, at a cost of $22 million. The second stage, a new single-point urban interchange at Echo Lake Road southwest of Monroe, was completed in 2006 at a cost of $37 million. The third stage of the SR 522 corridor project was completed in 2014, widening the highway to four lanes across the Snohomish River and through Monroe to US 2, where a new eastbound offramp was also constructed separately in 2012. A new roundabout at the 164th Street Southeast interchange was also opened as part of the project, completing the dogbone interchange.The remaining stages of the SR 522 corridor project between Maltby and the Snohomish River were planned to be funded by the Roads and Transit ballot measure in 2007, before it was rejected by local voters. The 2015 state transportation package included $10 million in design funding for an interchange at Paradise Lake Road in Maltby, to be made available in 2025, but construction of the interchange and widening of the remaining segment remains unfunded. The preliminary design options for the future diamond interchange would place the main ramps at either SR 524 or Paradise Lake Road. A coalition of politician and business leaders named \\\"Finish522\\\" was formed in 2018 to lobby the state government for barriers and complete grade separation in the wake of several fatal crashes in the mid-2010s. Long-term plans from WSDOT to address increasing traffic congestion in downtown Monroe include the construction of a highway bypass for US 2 to the north of the city. The project would include a northern extension of SR 522 to intersect the realigned US 2 near Kelsey Street and Chain Lake Road.\\n\\n\\n=== Mass transit ===\\n\\nThe western portion of SR 522, including Lake City Way and Bothell Way, is a major public transit corridor for the region and is served by Sound Transit Express and King County Metro bus routes. Bus lanes were added to sections of SR 522 in Seattle, Lake Forest Park, and Kenmore in the 1990s, and were expanded in the 2000s. In 2002, Sound Transit launched express Route 522, traveling between Downtown Seattle and Woodinville.Sound Transit plans to run a Stride bus rapid transit line on SR 522 from NE 145th Street to the University of Washington Bothell campus as part of its Sound Transit 3 program, approved in 2016. The line is scheduled to begin service in 2024 and will terminate at the NE 145th Street light rail station in Shoreline. The corridor has also been proposed for forms of rail transit since the mid-20th century, including the failed Forward Thrust ballot measures of 1968 and 1970, the Seattle Monorail Project, and light rail in the Sound Transit long-range plan.\\n\\n\\n== Major intersections ==\\nAll exits are unnumbered.\\n\\n\\n== References ==\\n\\n\\n== External links ==\\n\\n Media related to Washington State Route 522 at Wikimedia Commons\\nHighways of Washington State\",\n          \"The periodicity of solar eclipses is the interval between any two solar eclipses in succession, which will be either 1, 5, or 6 synodic months. It is calculated that the earth will experience a total number of 11,898 solar eclipses between 2000 BCE and 3000 CE. A particular solar eclipse will be repeated approximately after every 18 years 11 days and 8 hours (6,585.32 days) of period, but not in the same geographical region.\\nA particular geographical region will experience a particular solar eclipse in every 54 years 34 days period. Total solar eclipses are rare events, although they occur somewhere on Earth every 18 months on average,\\n\\n\\n== Repetition of solar eclipses ==\\nFor the repetition of a solar eclipse, the geometric alignment of the Earth, Moon and Sun, as well as some parameters of the lunar orbit should be repeated. The following parameters and criteria must be repeated for the repetition of a solar eclipse:\\nThe Moon must be in new phase.\\nThe longitude of perigee of the Moon must be the same.\\nThe longitude of the ascending node must be the same.\\nThe Earth will be nearly the same distance from the Sun, and tilted to it in nearly the same orientation.These conditions are related with the three periods of the Moon's orbital motion, viz. the synodic month, anomalistic month and draconic month. In other words, a particular eclipse will be repeated only if the Moon will complete roughly an integer number of synodic, draconic, and anomalistic periods (223, 242, and 239) and the Earth-Sun-Moon geometry will be nearly identical to that eclipse. The Moon will be at the same node and the same distance from the Earth. Gamma changes monotonically throughout any single Saros series. The change in gamma is larger when Earth is near its aphelion (June to July) than when it is near perihelion (December to January). When the Earth is near its average distance (March to April or September to October), the change in gamma is average. The first three conditions can be met after a time equal to the integral multiple of synodic, draconic, and anomalistic periods. The period is approximately equal to 6,585.32 days (18 years 11 days 8 hours).\\n\\n\\n== Eclipses would not occur in every month ==\\n\\nIf the Earth had a perfectly circular orbit centered around the Sun, and the Moon's orbit was also perfectly circular and centered around the Earth, and both orbits were coplanar (on the same plane) with each other, then two eclipses would happen every lunar month (29.53 days). A lunar eclipse would occur at every full moon, a solar eclipse every new moon, and all solar eclipses would be the same type. In fact the distances between the Earth and Moon and that of the Earth and the Sun vary because both the Earth and the Moon have elliptic orbits. Also, both the orbits are not on the same plane. The Moon's orbit is inclined about 5.14\\u00b0 to Earth's orbit around the Sun. So the Moon's orbit crosses the ecliptic at two points or nodes. If a New Moon takes place within about 17\\u00b0 of a node, then a solar eclipse will be visible from some location on Earth.At an average angular velocity of 0.99\\u00b0 per day, the Sun takes 34.5 days to cross the 34\\u00b0 wide eclipse zone centered on each node. Because the Moon's orbit with respect to the Sun has a mean duration of 29.53 days, there will always be one and possibly two solar eclipses during each 34.5-day interval when the Sun passes through the nodal eclipse zones. These time periods are called eclipse seasons. Either two or three eclipses happen each eclipse season. During the eclipse season, the inclination of the Moon's orbit is low, hence the Sun, Moon, and Earth become aligned straight enough (in syzygy) for an eclipse to occur.\\n\\n\\n== References ==\",\n          \"The Tocharian (sometimes Tokharian) languages ( or ), also known as Ar\\u015bi-Ku\\u010di, Agnean-Kuchean or Kuchean-Agnean, are an extinct branch of the Indo-European language family spoken by inhabitants of the Tarim Basin, the Tocharians. They are known from manuscripts dating from the 5th to the 8th century AD, which were found in oasis cities on the northern edge of the Tarim Basin (now part of Xinjiang in northwest China) and the Lop Desert. The discovery of this language family in the early 20th century contradicted the formerly prevalent idea of an east\\u2013west division of the Indo-European language family on the centum\\u2013satem isogloss, and prompted reinvigorated study of the family. Mistakenly identifying the authors with the Tokharoi people of ancient Bactria (Tokharistan), early authors called these languages \\\"Tocharian\\\". This naming has remained, although the names Agnean and Kuchean have been proposed as a replacement.The documents record two closely related languages, called Tocharian A (also East Tocharian, Agnean or Turfanian) and Tocharian B (West Tocharian or Kuchean). The subject matter of the texts suggests that Tocharian A was more archaic and used as a Buddhist liturgical language, while Tocharian B was more actively spoken in the entire area from Turfan in the east to Tumshuq in the west. A body of loanwords and names found in Prakrit documents from the Lop Nor basin have been dubbed Tocharian C (Kror\\u00e4nian). A claimed find of ten Tocharian C texts written in Kharo\\u1e63\\u1e6dh\\u012b script has been discredited.The oldest extant manuscripts in Tocharian B are now dated to the 5th or even late 4th century AD, making Tocharian a language of Late Antiquity contemporary with Gothic, Classical Armenian and Primitive Irish.\\n\\n\\n== Discovery and significance ==\\n\\nThe existence of the Tocharian languages and alphabet was not even suspected until archaeological exploration of the Tarim Basin by Aurel Stein in the early 20th century brought to light fragments of manuscripts in an unknown language, dating from the 6th to 8th centuries AD.It soon became clear that these fragments were actually written in two distinct but related languages belonging to a hitherto unknown branch of Indo-European, now known as Tocharian:\\n\\nTocharian A (Agnean or East Tocharian; natively \\u0101r\\u015bi) of Qara\\u0161\\u00e4h\\u00e4r (ancient Agni, Chinese Yanqi) and Turpan (ancient Turfan and Xo\\u010do), and\\nTocharian B (Kuchean or West Tocharian) of Kucha and Tocharian A sites.\\nPrakrit documents from 3rd-century Kror\\u00e4n and Niya on the southeast edge of the Tarim Basin contain loanwords and names that appear to come from a closely related language, referred to as Tocharian C.The discovery of Tocharian upset some theories about the relations of Indo-European languages and revitalized their study. In the 19th century, it was thought that the division between centum and satem languages was a simple west\\u2013east division, with centum languages in the west. The theory was undermined in the early 20th century by the discovery of Hittite, a centum language in a relatively eastern location, and Tocharian, which was a centum language despite being the easternmost branch. The result was a new hypothesis, following the wave model of Johannes Schmidt, suggesting that the satem isogloss represents a linguistic innovation in the central part of the Proto-Indo-European home range, and the centum languages along the eastern and the western peripheries did not undergo that change.Most scholars reject Walter Bruno Henning's proposed link to Gutian, a language spoken on the Iranian plateau in the 22nd century BC and known only from personal names.Tocharian probably died out after 840 when the Uyghurs, expelled from Mongolia by the Kyrgyz, moved into the Tarim Basin. The theory is supported by the discovery of translations of Tocharian texts into Uyghur.\\nSome modern Chinese words may ultimately derive from a Tocharian or related source, e.g. Old Chinese *mjit (\\u871c; m\\u00ec) \\\"honey\\\", from proto-Tocharian *\\u1e3f\\u0259t(\\u0259) (where *\\u1e3f is palatalized; cf. Tocharian B mit), cognate with English mead.\\n\\n\\n== Names ==\\n\\nA colophon to a Buddhist manuscript in Old Turkish from 800 AD states that it was translated from Sanskrit via a tw\\u03b3ry language.  In 1907, Emil Sieg and Friedrich W. K. M\\u00fcller guessed that this referred to the newly discovered language of the Turpan area.\\nSieg and M\\u00fcller, reading this name as toxr\\u00ef, connected it with the ethnonym T\\u00f3charoi (Ancient Greek: \\u03a4\\u03cc\\u03c7\\u03b1\\u03c1\\u03bf\\u03b9, Ptolemy VI, 11, 6, 2nd century AD), itself taken from Indo-Iranian (cf. Old Persian tux\\u0101ri-, Khotanese ttahv\\u0101ra, and Sanskrit tukh\\u0101ra), and proposed the name \\\"Tocharian\\\" (German Tocharisch).  Ptolemy's T\\u00f3charoi are often associated by modern scholars with the Yuezhi of Chinese historical accounts, who founded the Kushan empire. It is now clear that these people actually spoke Bactrian, an Eastern Iranian language, rather than the language of the Tarim manuscripts, so the term \\\"Tocharian\\\" is considered a misnomer.Nevertheless, it remains the standard term for the language of the Tarim Basin manuscripts.In 1938, Walter Henning found the term \\\"four tw\\u03b3ry\\\" used in early 9th-century manuscripts in Sogdian, Middle Iranian and Uighur.  He argued that it referred to the region on the northeast edge of the Tarim, including Agni and Karakhoja but not Kucha.  He thus inferred that the colophon referred to the Agnean language.Although the term tw\\u03b3ry or toxr\\u00ef appears to be the Old Turkic name for the Tocharians, it is not found in Tocharian texts.\\nThe apparent self-designation \\u0101r\\u015bi appears in Tocharian A texts. Tocharian B texts use the adjective ku\\u015bi\\u00f1\\u00f1e, derived from ku\\u015bi or ku\\u010di, a name also known from Chinese and Turkic documents. The historian Bernard Sergent compounded these names to coin an alternative term Ar\\u015bi-Ku\\u010di for the family, recently revised to Agni-Ku\\u010di, but this name has not achieved widespread usage.\\n\\n\\n== Writing system ==\\n\\nTocharian is documented in manuscript fragments, mostly from the 8th century (with a few earlier ones) that were written on palm leaves, wooden tablets and Chinese paper, preserved by the extremely dry climate of the Tarim Basin. Samples of the language have been discovered at sites in Kucha and Karasahr, including many mural inscriptions.\\nMost of attested Tocharian was written in the Tocharian alphabet, a derivative of the Brahmi alphabetic syllabary (abugida) also referred to as North Turkestan Brahmi or slanting Brahmi. However a smaller amount was written in the Manichaean script in which Manichaean texts were recorded. It soon became apparent that a large proportion of the manuscripts were translations of known Buddhist works in Sanskrit and some of them were even bilingual, facilitating decipherment of the new language. Besides the Buddhist and Manichaean religious texts, there were also monastery correspondence and accounts, commercial documents, caravan permits, medical and magical texts, and one love poem.\\nIn 1998, Chinese linguist Ji Xianlin published a translation and analysis of fragments of a Tocharian Maitreyasamiti-Nataka discovered in 1974 in Yanqi.\\n\\n\\n== Tocharian A and B ==\\n\\nTocharian A and B are significantly different, to the point of being mutually unintelligible.  A common Proto-Tocharian language must precede the attested languages by several centuries, probably dating to the late 1st millennium BC.Tocharian A is found only in the eastern part of the Tocharian-speaking area, and all extant texts are of a religious nature.  Tocharian B, however, is found throughout the range and in both religious and secular texts.  As a result, it has been suggested that Tocharian A was a liturgical language, no longer spoken natively, while Tocharian B was the spoken language of the entire area. On the other hand, it is possible that the lack of a secular corpus in Tocharian A is simply an accident, due to the smaller distribution of the language and the fragmentary preservation of Tocharian texts in general.The hypothesized relationship of Tocharian A and B as liturgical and spoken forms, respectively, is sometimes compared with the relationship between Latin and the modern Romance languages, or Classical Chinese and Mandarin. However, in both of these latter cases the liturgical language is the linguistic ancestor of the spoken language, whereas no such relationship holds between Tocharian A and B.  In fact, from a phonological perspective Tocharian B is significantly more conservative than Tocharian A, and serves as the primary source for reconstructing Proto-Tocharian. Only Tocharian B preserves the following Proto-Tocharian features: stress distinctions, final vowels, diphthongs, and o vs. e distinction. In turn, the loss of final vowels in Tocharian A has led to the loss of certain Proto-Tocharian categories still found in Tocharian B, e.g. the vocative case and some of the noun, verb and adjective declensional classes.\\nIn their declensional and conjugational endings, the two languages innovated in divergent ways, with neither clearly simpler than the other.  For example, both languages show significant innovations in the present active indicative endings but in radically different ways, so that only the second-person singular ending is directly cognate between the two languages, and in most cases neither variant is directly cognate with the corresponding Proto-Indo-European (PIE) form.  The agglutinative secondary case endings in the two languages likewise stem from different sources, showing parallel development of the secondary case system after the Proto-Tocharian period.  Likewise, some of the verb classes show independent origins, e.g. the class II preterite, which uses reduplication in Tocharian A (possibly from the reduplicated aorist) but long PIE \\u0113 in Tocharian B (possibly related to the long-vowel perfect found in Latin l\\u0113g\\u012b, f\\u0113c\\u012b, etc.).Tocharian B shows an internal chronological development; three linguistic stages have been detected. The oldest stage is attested only in Kucha. There are also the middle ('classical\\u02bc), and the late stage.\\n\\n\\n== Tocharian C ==\\nBased on 3rd-century Loulan G\\u0101ndh\\u0101r\\u012b Prakrit documents containing Tocharian loanwords such as kilme 'district', \\u1e63o\\u1e63tha\\u1e43ga 'tax collector', and \\u1e63ilpoga 'document', T. Burrow suggested in the 1930s the existence of a third Tocharian language, which has been labelled Tocharian C or \\\"Kror\\u00e4nian\\\", \\\"Krorainic\\\", or \\\"Lolanisch\\\".In 2018, ten texts written in the Kharo\\u1e63\\u1e6dh\\u012b alphabet from Loulan were published and analyzed in the posthumous papers of Tocharologist Klaus T. Schmidt as being written in Tocharian C.  Schmidt suggested that the language was closer to Tocharian B than to Tocharian A. On September 15 and 16, 2019, a group of linguists led by Georges Pinault and Micha\\u00ebl Peyrot met in Leiden to examine Schmidt's transcriptions and the original texts, and concluded they had all been transcribed entirely incorrectly. Their conclusions appear to have discredited Schmidt's Tocharian C claims.\\n\\n\\n== Phonology ==\\n\\nPhonetically, Tocharian languages are \\\"centum\\\" Indo-European languages, meaning that they merge the palatovelar consonants (*\\u1e31, *\\u01f5, *\\u01f5\\u02b0) of Proto Indo-European with the plain velars (*k, *g, *g\\u02b0) rather than palatalizing them to affricates or sibilants. Centum languages are mostly found in western and southern Europe (Greek, Italic, Celtic, Germanic). In that sense, Tocharian (to some extent like the Greek and the Anatolian languages) seems to have been an isolate in the \\\"satem\\\" (i.e. palatovelar to sibilant) phonetic regions of Indo-European-speaking populations. The discovery of Tocharian contributed to doubts that Proto-Indo-European had originally split into western and eastern branches; today, the centum\\u2013satem division is not seen as a real familial division.\\n\\n\\n=== Vowels ===\\nTocharian A and Tocharian B have the same set of vowels, but they often do not correspond to each other.  For example, the sound a did not occur in Proto-Tocharian. Tocharian B a  is derived from former stressed \\u00e4 or unstressed \\u0101 (reflected unchanged in Tocharian A), while Tocharian A a stems from Proto-Tocharian /\\u025b/ or /\\u0254/ (reflected as /e/ and /o/ in Tocharian B), and Tocharian A e and o stem largely from monophthongization of former diphthongs (still present in Tocharian B).\\n\\n\\n=== Diphthongs ===\\nDiphthongs occur in Tocharian B only.\\n\\n\\n=== Consonants ===\\n\\nThe following table lists the reconstructed phonemes in Tocharian along with their standard transcription.  Because Tocharian is written in an alphabet used originally for Sanskrit and its descendants, the transcription of the sounds is directly based on the transcription of the corresponding Sanskrit sounds.  The Tocharian alphabet also has letters representing all of the remaining Sanskrit sounds, but these appear only in Sanskrit loanwords and are not thought to have had distinct pronunciations in Tocharian.  There is some uncertainty as to actual pronunciation of some of the letters, particularly those representing palatalized obstruents (see below).\\n\\n/n/ is transcribed by two different letters in the Tocharian alphabet depending on position.  Based on the corresponding letters in Sanskrit, these are transcribed \\u1e43 (word-finally, including before certain clitics) and n (elsewhere), but \\u1e43 represents /n/, not /m/.\\nThe sound written c is thought to correspond to a palatal stop /c/ in Sanskrit.  The Tocharian pronunciation /t\\u0255/ is suggested by the common occurrence of the cluster \\u015bc, but the exact pronunciation cannot be determined with certainty.\\nThe sound written \\u1e63 corresponds to retroflex sibilant /\\u0282/ in Sanskrit, but it seems more likely to have been a palato-alveolar sibilant /\\u0283/ (as in English \\\"ship\\\"), because it derives from a palatalized /s/.\\nThe sound \\u1e45 /\\u014b/ occurs only before k, or in some clusters where a k has been deleted between consonants. It is clearly phonemic because sequences nk and \\u00f1k also exist (from syncope of a former \\u00e4 between them).\\n\\n\\n== Morphology ==\\n\\n\\n=== Nouns ===\\nTocharian has completely re-worked the nominal declension system of Proto-Indo-European. The only cases inherited from the proto-language are nominative, genitive, accusative, and (in Tocharian B only) vocative; in Tocharian the old accusative is known as the oblique case. In addition to these primary cases, however, each Tocharian language has six cases formed by the addition of an invariant suffix to the oblique case \\u2014 although the set of six cases is not the same in each language, and the suffixes are largely non-cognate. For example, the Tocharian word yakwe (Toch B), yuk (Toch A) \\\"horse\\\" < PIE *e\\u1e31wos is declined as follows:\\nThe Tocharian A instrumental case rarely occurs with humans.\\nWhen referring to humans, the oblique singular of most adjectives and of some nouns is marked in both varieties by an ending -(a)\\u1e43, which also appears in the secondary cases.  An example is e\\u1e45kwe (Toch B), o\\u1e45k (Toch A) \\\"man\\\", which belongs to the same declension as above, but has oblique singular e\\u1e45kwe\\u1e43 (Toch B), o\\u1e45ka\\u1e43 (Toch A), and corresponding oblique stems e\\u1e45kwe\\u1e43- (Toch B), o\\u1e45kn- (Toch A) for the secondary cases.  This is thought to stem from the generalization of n-stem adjectives as an indication of determinative semantics, seen most prominently in the weak adjective declension in the Germanic languages (where it cooccurs with definite articles and determiners), but also in Latin and Greek n-stem nouns (especially proper names) formed from adjectives, e.g. Latin Cat\\u014d (genitive Cat\\u014dnis) literally \\\"the sly one\\\" < catus \\\"sly\\\", Greek Pl\\u00e1t\\u014dn literally \\\"the broad-shouldered one\\\" < plat\\u00fas \\\"broad\\\".\\n\\n\\n=== Verbs ===\\n\\nIn contrast, the verb verbal conjugation system is quite conservative. The majority of Proto-Indo-European verbal classes and categories are represented in some manner in Tocharian, although not necessarily with the same function. Some examples: athematic and thematic present tenses, including null-, -y-, -s\\u1e31-, -s-, -n- and -nH- suffixes as well as n-infixes and various laryngeal-ending stems; o-grade and possibly lengthened-grade perfects (although lacking reduplication or augment); sigmatic, reduplicated, thematic and possibly lengthened-grade aorists; optatives; imperatives; and possibly PIE subjunctives.\\nIn addition, most PIE sets of endings are found in some form in Tocharian (although with significant innovations), including thematic and athematic endings, primary (non-past) and secondary (past) endings, active and mediopassive endings, and perfect endings.  Dual endings are still found, although they are rarely attested and generally restricted to the third person. The mediopassive still reflects the distinction between primary -r and secondary -i, effaced in most Indo-European languages.  Both root and suffix ablaut is still well-represented, although again with significant innovations.\\n\\n\\n==== Categories ====\\nTocharian verbs are conjugated in the following categories:\\nMood: indicative, subjunctive, optative, imperative.\\nTense/aspect (in the indicative only): present, preterite, imperfect.\\nVoice: active, mediopassive, deponent.\\nPerson: 1st, 2nd, 3rd.\\nNumber: singular, dual, plural.\\nCausation: basic, causative.\\nNon-finite: active participle, mediopassive participle, present gerundive, subjunctive gerundive.\\n\\n\\n==== Classes ====\\nA given verb belongs to one of a large number of classes, according to its conjugation.  As in Sanskrit, Ancient Greek and (to a lesser extent) Latin, there are independent sets of classes in the indicative present, subjunctive, perfect, imperative, and to a limited extent optative and imperfect, and there is no general correspondence among the different sets of classes, meaning that each verb must be specified using a number of principal parts.\\n\\n\\n===== Present indicative =====\\nThe most complex system is the present indicative, consisting of 12 classes, 8 thematic and 4 athematic, with distinct sets of thematic and athematic endings.  The following classes occur in Tocharian B (some are missing in Tocharian A):\\n\\nI: Athematic without suffix < PIE root athematic.\\nII: Thematic without suffix < PIE root thematic.\\nIII: Thematic with PToch suffix *-\\u00eb-. Mediopassive only.  Apparently reflecting consistent PIE o theme rather than the normal alternating o/e theme.\\nIV: Thematic with PToch suffix *-\\u0254-. Mediopassive only.  Same PIE origin as previous class, but diverging within Proto-Tocharian.\\nV: Athematic with PToch suffix *-\\u0101-, likely from either PIE verbs ending in a syllabic laryngeal or PIE derived verbs in *-eh\\u2082- (but extended to other verbs).\\nVI: Athematic with PToch suffix *-n\\u0101-, from PIE verbs in *-nH-.\\nVII: Athematic with infixed nasal, from PIE infixed nasal verbs.\\nVIII: Thematic with suffix -s-, possibly from PIE -s\\u1e31-?\\nIX: Thematic with suffix -sk- < PIE -s\\u1e31-.\\nX: Thematic with PToch suffix *-n\\u00e4sk/n\\u0101sk- (evidently a combination of classes VI and IX).\\nXI: Thematic in PToch suffix *-s\\u00e4sk- (evidently a combination of classes VIII and IX).\\nXII: Thematic with PToch suffix *-(\\u00e4)\\u00f1\\u00f1- < either PIE *-n-y- (denominative to n-stem nouns) or PIE *-nH-y- (deverbative from PIE *-nH- verbs).Palatalization of the final root consonant occurs in the 2nd singular, 3rd singular, 3rd dual and 2nd plural in thematic classes II and VIII-XII as a result of the original PIE thematic vowel e.\\n\\n\\n===== Subjunctive =====\\nThe subjunctive likewise has 12 classes, denoted i through xii.  Most are conjugated identically to the corresponding indicative classes; indicative and subjunctive are distinguished by the fact that a verb in a given indicative class will usually belong to a different subjunctive class.\\nIn addition, four subjunctive classes differ from the corresponding indicative classes, two \\\"special subjunctive\\\" classes with differing suffixes and two \\\"varying subjunctive\\\" classes with root ablaut reflecting the PIE perfect.\\nSpecial subjunctives:\\n\\niv: Thematic with suffix i < PIE -y-, with consistent palatalization of final root consonant.  Tocharian B only, rare.\\nvii: Thematic (not athematic, as in indicative class VII) with suffix \\u00f1 < PIE -n- (palatalized by thematic e, with palatalized variant generalized).Varying subjunctives:\\n\\ni: Athematic without suffix, with root ablaut reflecting PIE o-grade in active singular, zero-grade elsewhere.  Derived from PIE perfect.\\nv: Identical to class i but with PToch suffix *-\\u0101-, originally reflecting laryngeal-final roots but generalized.\\n\\n\\n===== Preterite =====\\nThe preterite has 6 classes:\\n\\nI: The most common class, with a suffix \\u0101 < PIE \\u1e24 (i.e. roots ending in a laryngeal, although widely extended to other roots).  This class shows root ablaut, with original e-grade (and palatalization of the initial root consonant) in the active singular, contrasting with zero-grade (and no palatalization) elsewhere.\\nII: This class has reduplication in Tocharian A (possibly reflecting the PIE reduplicated aorist).  However, Tocharian B has a vowel reflecting long PIE \\u0113, along with palatalization of the initial root consonant.  There is no ablaut in this class.\\nIII: This class has a suffix s in the 3rd singular active and throughout the mediopassive, evidently reflecting the PIE sigmatic aorist.  Root ablaut occurs between active and mediopassive.  A few verbs have palatalization in the active along with s in the 3rd singular, but no palatalization and no s in the mediopassive, along with no root ablaut (the vowel reflects PToch \\u00eb).  This suggests that, for these verbs in particular, the active originates in the PIE sigmatic aorist (with s suffix and \\u0113 vocalism) while the mediopassive stems from the PIE perfect (with o vocalism).\\nIV: This class has suffix \\u1e63\\u1e63\\u0101, with no ablaut.  Most verbs in this class are causatives.\\nV: This class has suffix \\u00f1(\\u00f1)\\u0101, with no ablaut.  Only a few verbs belong to this class.\\nVI: This class, which has only two verbs, is derived from the PIE thematic aorist.  As in Greek, this class has different endings from all the others, which partly reflect the PIE secondary endings (as expected for the thematic aorist).All except preterite class VI have a common set of endings that stem from the PIE perfect endings, although with significant innovations.\\n\\n\\n===== Imperative =====\\nThe imperative likewise shows 6 classes, with a unique set of endings, found only in the second person, and a prefix beginning with p-.  This prefix usually reflects Proto-Tocharian *p\\u00e4- but unexpected connecting vowels occasionally occur, and the prefix combines with vowel-initial and glide-initial roots in unexpected ways.  The prefix is often compared with the Slavic perfective prefix po-, although the phonology is difficult to explain.\\nClasses i through v tend to co-occur with preterite classes I through V, although there are many exceptions.  Class vi is not so much a coherent class as an \\\"irregular\\\" class with all verbs not fitting in other categories.  The imperative classes tend to share the same suffix as the corresponding preterite (if any), but to have root vocalism that matches the vocalism of a verb's subjunctive.  This includes the root ablaut of subjunctive classes i and v, which tend to co-occur with imperative class i.\\n\\n\\n===== Optative and imperfect =====\\nThe optative and imperfect have related formations. The optative is generally built by adding i onto the subjunctive stem.  Tocharian B likewise forms the imperfect by adding i onto the present indicative stem, while Tocharian A has 4 separate imperfect formations: usually \\u0101 is added to the subjunctive stem, but occasionally to the indicative stem, and sometimes either \\u0101 or s is added directly onto the root.  The endings differ between the two languages: Tocharian A uses present endings for the optative and preterite endings for the imperfect, while Tocharian B uses the same endings for both, which are a combination of preterite and unique endings (the latter used in the singular active).\\n\\n\\n==== Endings ====\\nAs suggested by the above discussion, there are a large number of sets of endings.  The present-tense endings come in both thematic and athematic variants, although they are related, with the thematic endings generally reflecting a theme vowel (PIE e or o) plus the athematic endings.  There are different sets for the preterite classes I through V; preterite class VI; the imperative; and in Tocharian B, in the singular active of the optative and imperfect.  Furthermore, each set of endings comes with both active and mediopassive forms.  The mediopassive forms are quite conservative, directly reflecting the PIE variation between -r in the present and -i in the past.

the seattle metropolitan area approximately miles km long it connects the city of seattle to the northeastern suburbs of kenmore bothell woodinville and monroe its western half is primarily an arterial street named lake city way and bothell way that follows the northern shore of lake washington the eastern half is a grade separated freeway that runs between woodinville and monroe SR connects several of the metropolitan area s major highways including interstate i i SR and US route US the present day route of SR was built in stages between and beginning with the red brick road from seattle to bothell then part of the pacific highway and later US the road later became a branch of primary state highway PSH in and was extended east to redmond and north bend a branch of the stevens pass highway was built to connect PSH in bothell and monroe in and was incorporated into SR after it was designated in the bothell monroe highway was re designated as part of SR in leaving SR on the bothell north bend highway since the late s the SR corridor between woodinville and monroe has been partially converted to a freeway to address safety concerns and a growing population portions of the highway near woodinville and monroe were widened between and while other sections near maltby remain two lanes wide and undivided with improvement projects left unfunded route description SR named lake city way within seattle city limits begins at an interchange with i in the roosevelt neighborhood of northern seattle east of green lake the interchange only allows movements south towards downtown seattle on i and includes a connection to the freeway s reversible express lane system the highway travels northeast from the interchange tunneling under the intersection of roosevelt way NE and NE th street the intersection itself is connected to SR by a series of ramps to collector streets lake city way continues northeast through maple leaf as a four lane arterial street before turning north on its approach to thornton creek after crossing the creek the highway enters the lake city neighborhood passing several car dealerships lake city itself is a designated urban village with mixed use development and apartment buildings that are centered around the intersection of lake city way between NE th street and NE th street at NE th street SR intersects SR and crosses into lake forest park beyond seattle the highway is named bothell way and follows the northern shore of lake washington SR intersects ballinger way SR at the central shopping center in lake forest park and is joined by the burke gilman trail a multi use trail running along the lakefront on a former railroad grade bothell way continues east along the northern shore of lake washington through the city of kenmore located on the mouth of the sammamish river and home to the kenmore air harbor seaplane base SR travels upriver through a narrow valley that makes a sharp turn north towards bothell the highway turns east and continues downhill of the city s downtown business district staying near the sammamish river and the sammamish river trail and intersecting bothell way formerly SR leaving bothell SR then travels around the southern edge of university of washington bothell campus and intersects i becoming a grade separated freeway east of i SR enters woodinville and follows little bear creek as it turns north away from the city s downtown intersecting SR the freeway enters snohomish county and intersects SR south of the brightwater sewage treatment plant it continues through several sharp turns that follow the eastside rail corridor a former railroad grade that runs northeasterly through the predominantly rural area near grace in maltby the freeway reaches an at grade intersection with paradise lake road SR and becomes a two lane undivided highway SR travels northeast from maltby intersecting echo lake road in a single point urban interchange and crosses the snohomish river into monroe within monroe the highway widens to a four lane freeway with median separation and intersects main street in a dogbone interchange near the monroe correctional complex SR cuts across suburban housing areas in monroe and crosses over US and the BNSF railway near the evergreen state fairgrounds the highway makes a degree turn south to intersect with US where it terminates the intersection also has a direct offramp for eastbound traffic from SR to eastbound US the entire route of SR is designated as part of the national highway system classifying it as important to the national economy defense and mobility the state of washington also designates the SR corridor as a highway of statewide significance which includes highways that connect major communities throughout the state the highway is the primary route for seattle area residents to access stevens pass and other parts of the cascade mountains SR is maintained by the washington state department of transportation WSDOT which conducts an annual survey on the state s highways to measure traffic volume in terms of average annual daily traffic in WSDOT calculated that vehicles used SR at its interchange with i and vehicles used it at its eastern terminus in monroe the highest and lowest counts along the highway respectively history red brick road logging settlements were established on the northern shore of lake washington in the s and s relying primarily on the water for intercity transportation the seattle lake shore and eastern railway was built along the lakefront in connecting seattle to the new towns of bothell and kenmore by the s unpaved logging trails had been completed along lake washington and the railroad reaching as far northeast as maltby bothell businessman and good roads advocate gerhard ericksen successfully lobbied the washington state legislature to fund the construction of a road from seattle to bothell as a state aid road and permanent highway in the first section of the highway traveling miles km from ravenna park in seattle to lake forest park was completed in and was pronounced by the seattle times as one of the finest pieces of road to be found anywhere in the united states from to the state and county government paved miles km of the highway between lake forest park and bothell with bricks the highway named the ericksen road after its promoter and bothell road after the city of bothell was opened on january in an event named the boulevard blowout that featured automobiles traversing the entire route between seattle and bothell most of the brick road was replaced in but a section south of downtown bothell was preserved and remains known as red brick road park federal and state highways the bothell road became part of the pacific highway in forming part of the highway that would continue north from bothell towards everett in the original road alignment through modern day lake city was bypassed by the new concrete paved victory way dedicated in the memory of world war i veterans the pacific highway was incorporated into a new national highway system that was approved by the american association of state highway officials on november and numbered as US on october the north trunk highway was opened between seattle and everett providing a shorter and more direct route that would later be designated as US and the pacific highway the bothell highway was renovated from seattle to lake forest park in including a widening to four lanes and straightening of some segments part of the highway in seattle city limits was renamed to lake city way in after lobbying from lake city businessmen an unpaved extension of the bothell road traveling along the sammamish river to woodinville redmond and fall city was designated as a branch of the sunset highway state road in the highway was later paved and incorporated into a longer branch of the sunset highway re designated as primary state highway in running from downtown seattle to fall city the branch highway was extended to north bend after the opening of a sunset highway bypass in using the former mainline road another branch of the bothell road from bothell to the stevens pass highway primary state highway in monroe was proposed by the state good roads association in the late s in funding for this segment was rejected by the state senate in favor of completing the highway between everett and monroe first the bothell monroe cutoff was designated as a branch of primary state highway in with a provision that the highway would be constructed after the completion of the everett monroe route the king county government also unsuccessfully lobbied in the early s for a mile km highway connecting duvall to skykomish along the tolt river as an alternative to the monroe cutoff construction of the highway was pushed back to and it was further delayed by rainy weather the mile long km bothell monroe cutoff opened on february costing million equivalent to million in dollars and cutting minutes in travel time between seattle and the stevens pass ski area in the washington state legislature commissioned a new state highway numbering system to ease confusion over similarly numbered routes the new system debuted in initially with state route SR assigned to the branch of primary state highway from seattle to north bend and state route SR assigned to the branch of primary state highway from woodinville to monroe by SR had been moved to the bothell monroe cutoff while SR was moved to the woodinville north bend highway freeway expansion and safety improvements the north seattle section of the everett seattle freeway now i opened on august including access to bothell way in the roosevelt neighborhood SR was truncated to i removing roosevelt way and eastlake avenue from the state highway system a four level freeway interchange with i east of bothell was completed in creating a connection between SR and SR in the state highway department proposed the conversion of SR into a freeway bypassing lake city way and bothell way the plan drew heavy opposition from local residents who feared bottlenecks and a reduction in quality of life and was removed from regional freeway plans in freeway plans in monroe moved forward instead with the completion of a two mile long km bypass to the west of downtown in SR was moved from its routing on main street to the new freeway which terminated at US and removed a railroad grade crossing from the route since the s population growth in monroe and around the SR has resulted in increased traffic congestion and safety issues including a rise in accidents and crashes the highway was originally designed for eventual conversion into a four lane freeway with leftover right of way and bridge approaches built in between and the mile long km stretch of SR between woodinville and monroe was the site of over accidents and deaths SR has been named as one of the most dangerous highways in the united states by reader s digest in and forbes in among other lists the rock band state route formed in by local indie rock musician jake snider was named for the highway in response to the crashes on SR local residents organized a grassroots campaign citizens rallying for a safer highway to petition the state for safety improvements and a highway widening in the state legislature allocated million equivalent to million in dollars in funding towards a five stage widening project but the funds were transferred to the general fund at the behest of governor mike lowry the supplemental transportation budget included million for engineering studies on SR with construction of a four lane freeway funded through other means state lawmakers recommended tolling SR to pay off construction bonds but the plan was pulled back after opposition from local residents existing state funds were used for the first stages of the SR corridor project including the addition of median rumble strips and improved pavement markers in which helped reduce head on collisions the city of monroe replaced the eastern half of SR interchange with main street th street southeast with a roundabout the first to be built in snohomish county in the first stage of the corridor project was completed in and widened a section between SR and paradise lake road SR in maltby at a cost of million the second stage a new single point urban interchange at echo lake road southwest of monroe was completed in at a cost of million the third stage of the SR corridor project was completed in widening the highway to four lanes across the snohomish river and through monroe to US where a new eastbound offramp was also constructed separately in a new roundabout at the th street southeast interchange was also opened as part of the project completing the dogbone interchange the remaining stages of the SR corridor project between maltby and the snohomish river were planned to be funded by the roads and transit ballot measure in before it was rejected by local voters the state transportation package included million in design funding for an interchange at paradise lake road in maltby to be made available in but construction of the interchange and widening of the remaining segment remains unfunded the preliminary design options for the future diamond interchange would place the main ramps at either SR or paradise lake road a coalition of politician and business leaders named finish was formed in to lobby the state government for barriers and complete grade separation in the wake of several fatal crashes in the mid s long term plans from WSDOT to address increasing traffic congestion in downtown monroe include the construction of a highway bypass for US to the north of the city the project would include a northern extension of SR to intersect the realigned US near kelsey street and chain lake road mass transit the western portion of SR including lake city way and bothell way is a major public transit corridor for the region and is served by sound transit express and king county metro bus routes bus lanes were added to sections of SR in seattle lake forest park and kenmore in the s and were expanded in the s in sound transit launched express route traveling between downtown seattle and woodinville sound transit plans to run a stride bus rapid transit line on SR from NE th street to the university of washington bothell campus as part of its sound transit program approved in the line is scheduled to begin service in and will terminate at the NE th street light rail station in shoreline the corridor has also been proposed for forms of rail transit since the mid th century including the failed forward thrust ballot measures of and the seattle monorail project and light rail

experience a total number of solar eclipses between BCE and CE a particular solar eclipse will be repeated approximately after every years days and hours days of period but not in the same geographical region a particular geographical region will experience a particular solar eclipse in every years days period total solar eclipses are rare events although they occur somewhere on earth every months on average repetition of solar eclipses for the repetition of a solar eclipse the geometric alignment of the earth moon and sun as well as some parameters of the lunar orbit should be repeated the following parameters and criteria must be repeated for the repetition of a solar eclipse the moon must be in new phase the longitude of perigee of the moon must be the same the longitude of the ascending node must be the same the earth will be nearly the same distance from the sun and tilted to it in nearly the same orientation these conditions are related with the three periods of the moon s orbital motion viz the synodic month anomalistic month and draconic month in other words a particular eclipse will be repeated only if the moon will complete roughly an integer number of synodic draconic and anomalistic periods and and the earth sun moon geometry will be nearly identical to that eclipse the moon will be at the same node and the same distance from the earth gamma changes monotonically throughout any single saros series the change in gamma is larger when earth is near its aphelion june to july than when it is near perihelion december to january when the earth is near its average distance march to april or september to october the change in gamma is average the first three conditions can be met after a time equal to the integral multiple of synodic draconic and anomalistic periods the period is approximately equal to days years days hours eclipses would not occur in every month if the earth had a perfectly circular orbit centered around the sun and the moon s orbit was also perfectly circular and centered around the earth and both orbits were coplanar on the same plane with each other then two eclipses would happen every lunar month days a lunar eclipse would occur at every full moon a solar eclipse every new moon and all solar eclipses would be the same type in fact the distances between the earth and moon and that of the earth and the sun vary because both the earth and the moon have elliptic orbits also both the orbits are not on the same plane the moon s orbit is inclined about to earth s orbit around the sun so the moon s orbit crosses the ecliptic at two points or nodes if a new moon takes place within about of a node then a solar eclipse will be visible from some location on earth at an average angular velocity of per day the sun takes days to cross the wide eclipse zone centered on each node because the moon s orbit with respect to the sun has a mean duration of days there will always be one and possibly two solar eclipses during each day interval when the sun passes through the nodal eclipse zones these time periods are called eclipse seasons either two or three eclipses happen each eclipse season during the eclipse season the inclination of the moon s orbit is low hence the sun moon and earth become aligned straight enough in syzygy for an eclipse to occur references\",\n          \"the tocharian sometimes tokharian languages or also known as ar\\u015bi ku\\u010di agnean kuchean or kuchean agnean are an extinct branch of the indo european language family spoken by inhabitants of the tarim basin the tocharians they are known from manuscripts dating from the th to the th century AD which were found in oasis cities on the northern edge of the tarim basin now part of xinjiang in northwest china and the lop desert the discovery of this language family in the early th century contradicted the formerly prevalent idea of an east west division of the indo european language family on the centum satem isogloss and prompted reinvigorated study of the family mistakenly identifying the authors with the tokharoi people of ancient bactria tokharistan early authors called these languages tocharian this naming has remained although the names agnean and kuchean have been proposed as a replacement the documents record two closely related languages called tocharian a also east tocharian agnean or turfanian and tocharian b west tocharian or kuchean the subject matter of the texts suggests that tocharian a was more archaic and used as a buddhist liturgical language while tocharian b was more actively spoken in the entire area from turfan in the east to tumshuq in the west a body of loanwords and names found in prakrit documents from the lop nor basin have been dubbed tocharian c kror\\u00e4nian a claimed find of ten tocharian c texts written in kharo\\u1e63\\u1e6dh\\u012b script has been discredited the oldest extant manuscripts in tocharian b are now dated to the th or even late th century AD making tocharian a language of late antiquity contemporary with gothic classical armenian and primitive irish discovery and significance the existence of the tocharian languages and alphabet was not even suspected until archaeological exploration of the tarim basin by aurel stein in the early th century brought to light fragments of manuscripts in an unknown language dating from the th to th centuries AD it soon became clear that these fragments were actually written in two distinct but related languages belonging to a hitherto unknown branch of indo european now known as tocharian tocharian a agnean or east tocharian natively \\u0101r\\u015bi of qara\\u0161\\u00e4h\\u00e4r ancient agni chinese yanqi and turpan ancient turfan and xo\\u010do and tocharian b kuchean or west tocharian of kucha and tocharian a sites prakrit documents from rd century kror\\u00e4n and niya on the southeast edge of the tarim basin contain loanwords and names that appear to come from a closely related language referred to as tocharian c the discovery of tocharian upset some theories about the relations of indo european languages and revitalized their study in the th century it was thought that the division between centum and satem languages was a simple west east division with centum languages in the west the theory was undermined in the early th century by the discovery of hittite a centum language in a relatively eastern location and tocharian which was a centum language despite being the easternmost branch the result was a new hypothesis following the wave model of johannes schmidt suggesting that the satem isogloss represents a linguistic innovation in the central part of the proto indo european home range and the centum languages along the eastern and the western peripheries did not undergo that change most scholars reject walter bruno henning s proposed link to gutian a language spoken on the iranian plateau in the nd century BC and known only from personal names tocharian probably died out after when the uyghurs expelled from mongolia by the kyrgyz moved into the tarim basin the theory is supported by the discovery of translations of tocharian

accounts who founded the kushan empire it is now clear that these people actually spoke bactrian an eastern iranian language rather than the language of the tarim manuscripts so the term tocharian is considered a misnomer nevertheless it remains the standard term for the language of the tarim basin manuscripts in walter henning found the term four tw\\u03b3ry used in early th century manuscripts in sogdian middle iranian and uighur he argued that it referred to the region on the northeast edge of the tarim including agni and karakhoja but not kucha he thus inferred that the colophon referred to the agnean language although the term tw\\u03b3ry or toxr\\u00ef appears to be the old turkic name for the tocharians it is not found in tocharian texts the apparent self designation \\u0101r\\u015bi appears in tocharian a texts tocharian b texts use the adjective ku\\u015bi\\u00f1\\u00f1e derived from ku\\u015bi or ku\\u010di a name also known from chinese and turkic documents the historian bernard sergent compounded these names to coin an alternative term ar\\u015bi ku\\u010di for the family recently revised to agni ku\\u010di but this name has not achieved widespread usage writing system tocharian is documented in manuscript fragments mostly from the th century with a few earlier ones that were written on palm leaves wooden tablets and chinese paper preserved by the extremely dry climate of the tarim basin samples of the language have been discovered at sites in kucha and karasahr including many mural inscriptions most of attested tocharian was written in the tocharian alphabet a derivative of the brahmi alphabetic syllabary abugida also referred to as north turkestan brahmi or slanting brahmi however a smaller amount was written in the manichaean script in which manichaean texts were recorded it soon became apparent that a large proportion of the manuscripts were translations of known buddhist works in sanskrit and some of them were even bilingual facilitating decipherment of the new language besides the buddhist and manichaean religious texts there were also monastery correspondence and accounts commercial documents caravan permits medical and magical texts and one love poem in chinese linguist ji xianlin published a translation and analysis of fragments of a tocharian maitreyasamiti nataka discovered in in yanqi tocharian a and b tocharian a and b are significantly different to the point of being mutually unintelligible a common proto tocharian language must precede the attested languages by several centuries probably dating to the late st millennium BC tocharian a is found only in the eastern part of the tocharian speaking area and all extant texts are of a religious nature tocharian b however is found throughout the range and in both religious and secular texts as a result it has been suggested that tocharian a was a liturgical language no longer spoken natively while tocharian b was the spoken language of the entire area on the other hand it is possible that the lack of a secular corpus in tocharian a is simply an accident due to the smaller distribution of the language and the fragmentary preservation of tocharian texts in general the hypothesized relationship of tocharian a and b as liturgical and spoken forms respectively is sometimes compared with the relationship between latin and the modern romance languages or classical chinese and mandarin however in both of these latter cases the liturgical language is the linguistic ancestor of the spoken language whereas no such relationship holds between tocharian a and b in fact from a phonological perspective tocharian b is significantly more conservative than tocharian a and serves as the primary source for reconstructing proto tocharian only tocharian b preserves the following proto tocharian features stress distinctions final vowels diphthongs and o vs e distinction in turn the loss of final vowels in tocharian a has led to the loss of certain proto tocharian categories still found in tocharian b e g the vocative case and some of the noun verb and adjective declensional classes in their declensional and conjugational endings the two languages innovated in divergent ways with neither clearly simpler than the other for example both languages show significant innovations in the present active indicative endings but in radically different ways so that only the second person singular ending is directly cognate between the two languages and in most cases neither variant is directly cognate with the corresponding proto indo european PIE form the agglutinative secondary case endings in the two languages likewise stem from different sources showing parallel development of the secondary case system after the proto tocharian period likewise some of the verb classes show independent origins e g the class II preterite which uses reduplication in tocharian a possibly from the reduplicated aorist but long PIE \\u0113 in tocharian b possibly related to the long vowel perfect found in latin l\\u0113g\\u012b f\\u0113c\\u012b etc tocharian b shows an internal chronological development three linguistic stages have been detected the oldest stage is attested only in kucha there are also the middle classical\\u02bc and the late stage tocharian c based on rd century loulan g\\u0101ndh\\u0101r\\u012b prakrit documents containing tocharian loanwords such as kilme district \\u1e63o\\u1e63tha\\u1e43ga tax collector and \\u1e63ilpoga document t burrow suggested in the s the existence of a third tocharian language which has been labelled tocharian c or kror\\u00e4nian krorainic or lolanisch in ten texts written in the kharo\\u1e63\\u1e6dh\\u012b alphabet from loulan were published and analyzed in the posthumous papers of tocharologist klaus t schmidt as being written in tocharian c schmidt suggested that the language was closer to tocharian b than to tocharian a on september and a group of linguists led by georges pinault and micha\\u00ebl peyrot met in leiden to examine schmidt s transcriptions and the original texts and concluded they had all been transcribed entirely incorrectly their conclusions appear to have discredited schmidt s tocharian c claims phonology phonetically tocharian languages are centum indo european languages meaning that they merge the palatovelar consonants \\u1e31 \\u01f5 \\u01f5\\u02b0 of proto indo european with the plain velars k g g\\u02b0 rather than palatalizing them to affricates or sibilants centum languages are mostly found in western and southern europe greek italic celtic germanic in that sense tocharian to some extent like the greek and the anatolian languages seems to have been an isolate in the satem i e palatovelar to sibilant phonetic regions of indo european speaking populations the discovery of tocharian contributed to doubts that proto indo european had originally split into western and eastern branches today the centum satem division is not seen as a real familial division vowels tocharian a and tocharian b have the same set of vowels but they often do not correspond to each other for example the sound a did not occur in proto tocharian tocharian b a is derived from former stressed \\u00e4 or unstressed \\u0101 reflected unchanged in tocharian a while tocharian a a stems from proto tocharian \\u025b or \\u0254 reflected as e and o in tocharian b and tocharian a e and o stem largely from monophthongization of former diphthongs still present in tocharian b diphthongs diphthongs occur in tocharian b only consonants the following table lists the reconstructed phonemes in tocharian along with their standard transcription because tocharian is written in an alphabet used originally for sanskrit and its descendants the transcription of the sounds is directly based on the transcription of the corresponding sanskrit sounds the tocharian alphabet also has letters representing all of the remaining sanskrit sounds but these appear only in sanskrit loanwords and are not thought to have had distinct pronunciations in tocharian there is some uncertainty as to actual pronunciation of some of the letters particularly those representing palatalized obstruents see below n is transcribed by two different letters in the tocharian alphabet depending on position based on the corresponding letters in sanskrit these are transcribed \\u1e43 word finally including before certain clitics and n elsewhere but \\u1e43 represents n not m the sound written c is thought to correspond to a palatal stop c in sanskrit the tocharian pronunciation t\\u0255 is suggested by the common occurrence of the cluster \\u015bc but the exact pronunciation cannot be determined with certainty the sound written \\u1e63 corresponds to retroflex sibilant \\u0282 in sanskrit but it seems more likely to have been a palato alveolar sibilant \\u0283 as in english ship because it derives from a palatalized s the sound \\u1e45 \\u014b occurs only before k or in some clusters where a k has been deleted between consonants it is clearly phonemic because sequences nk and \\u00f1k also exist from syncope of a former \\u00e4 between them morphology nouns tocharian has completely re worked the nominal declension system of proto indo european the only cases inherited from the proto language are nominative genitive accusative and in tocharian b only vocative in tocharian the old accusative is known as the oblique case in addition to these primary cases however each tocharian language has six cases formed by the addition of an invariant suffix to the oblique case although the set of six cases is not the same in each language and the suffixes are largely non cognate for example the tocharian word yakwe toch b yuk toch a horse PIE e\\u1e31wos is declined as follows the tocharian a instrumental case rarely occurs with humans when referring to humans the oblique singular of most adjectives and of some nouns is marked in both varieties by an ending a \\u1e43 which also appears in the secondary cases an example is e\\u1e45kwe toch b o\\u1e45k toch a man which belongs to the same declension as above but has oblique singular e\\u1e45kwe\\u1e43 toch b o\\u1e45ka\\u1e43 toch a and corresponding oblique stems e\\u1e45kwe\\u1e43 toch b o\\u1e45kn toch a for the secondary cases this is thought to stem from the generalization of n stem adjectives as an indication of determinative semantics seen most prominently in the weak adjective declension in the germanic languages where it cooccurs with definite articles and determiners but also in latin and greek n stem nouns especially proper names formed from adjectives e g latin cat\\u014d genitive cat\\u014dnis literally the sly one catus sly greek pl\\u00e1t\\u014dn literally the broad shouldered one plat\\u00fas broad verbs in contrast the verb verbal conjugation system is quite conservative the majority of proto indo european verbal classes and categories are represented in some manner in tocharian although not necessarily with the same function some examples athematic and thematic present tenses including null y s\\u1e31 s n and nh suffixes as well as n infixes and various laryngeal ending stems o grade and possibly lengthened grade perfects although lacking reduplication or augment sigmatic reduplicated thematic and possibly lengthened grade aorists optatives imperatives and possibly PIE subjunctives in addition most PIE sets of endings are found in some form in tocharian although with significant innovations including thematic and athematic endings primary non past and secondary past endings active and mediopassive endings and perfect endings dual endings are still found although they are rarely attested and generally restricted to the third person the mediopassive still reflects the distinction between primary r and secondary i effaced in most indo european languages both root and suffix ablaut is still well represented although again with significant innovations categories tocharian verbs are conjugated in the following categories mood indicative subjunctive optative imperative tense aspect in the indicative only present preterite imperfect voice active mediopassive deponent person st nd rd number singular dual plural causation basic causative non finite active participle mediopassive participle present gerundive subjunctive gerundive classes a given verb belongs to one of a large number of classes according to its conjugation as in sanskrit ancient greek and to a lesser extent latin there are independent sets of classes in the indicative present subjunctive perfect imperative and to a limited extent optative and imperfect and there is no general correspondence among the different sets of classes meaning that each verb must be specified using a number of principal parts present indicative the most complex system is the present indicative consisting of classes thematic and athematic with distinct sets of thematic and athematic endings the following classes occur in tocharian b some are missing in tocharian a i athematic without suffix PIE root athematic II thematic without suffix PIE root thematic III thematic with ptoch suffix \\u00eb mediopassive only apparently reflecting consistent PIE o theme rather than the normal alternating o e theme IV thematic with ptoch suffix \\u0254 mediopassive only same PIE origin as previous class but diverging within proto tocharian v athematic with ptoch suffix \\u0101 likely from either PIE verbs ending in a syllabic laryngeal or PIE derived verbs in eh\\u2082 but extended to other verbs VI athematic with ptoch suffix n\\u0101 from PIE verbs in nh VII athematic with infixed nasal from PIE infixed nasal verbs VIII thematic with suffix s possibly from PIE s\\u1e31 IX thematic with suffix sk PIE s\\u1e31 x thematic with ptoch suffix n\\u00e4sk n\\u0101sk evidently a combination of classes VI and IX XI thematic in ptoch suffix s\\u00e4sk evidently a combination of classes VIII and IX XII thematic with ptoch suffix \\u00e4 \\u00f1\\u00f1 either PIE n y denominative to n stem nouns or PIE nh y deverbative from PIE nh verbs palatalization of the final root consonant occurs in the nd singular rd singular rd dual and nd plural in thematic classes II and VIII XII as a result of the original PIE thematic vowel e subjunctive the subjunctive likewise has classes denoted i through xii most are conjugated identically to the corresponding indicative classes indicative and subjunctive are distinguished by the fact that a verb in a given indicative class will usually belong to a different subjunctive class in addition four subjunctive classes differ from the corresponding indicative classes two special subjunctive classes with differing suffixes and two varying subjunctive classes with root ablaut reflecting the PIE perfect special subjunctives iv thematic with suffix i PIE y with consistent palatalization of final root consonant tocharian b only rare vii thematic not athematic as in indicative class VII with suffix \\u00f1 PIE n palatalized by thematic e with palatalized variant generalized varying subjunctives i athematic without suffix with root ablaut reflecting PIE o grade in active singular zero grade elsewhere derived from PIE perfect v identical to class i but with ptoch suffix \\u0101 originally reflecting laryngeal final roots but generalized preterite the preterite has classes i the most common class with a suffix \\u0101 PIE \\u1e25 i e roots ending in a laryngeal although widely extended to other roots this class shows root ablaut with original e grade and palatalization of the initial root consonant in the active singular contrasting with zero grade and no palatalization elsewhere II this class has reduplication in tocharian a possibly reflecting the PIE reduplicated aorist however tocharian b has a vowel reflecting long PIE \\u0113 along with palatalization of the initial root consonant there is no ablaut in this class III this class has a suffix s in the rd singular active and throughout the mediopassive evidently reflecting the PIE sigmatic aorist root ablaut occurs between active and mediopassive a few verbs have palatalization in the active along with s in the rd singular but no palatalization and no s in the mediopassive along with no root ablaut the vowel reflects ptoch \\u00eb this suggests that for these verbs in particular the active originates in the PIE sigmatic aorist with s suffix and \\u0113 vocalism while the mediopassive stems from the PIE perfect with o vocalism IV this class has suffix \\u1e63\\u1e63\\u0101 with no ablaut most verbs in this class are causatives v this class has suffix \\u00f1 \\u00f1 \\u0101 with no ablaut only a few verbs belong to this class VI this class which has only two verbs is derived from the PIE thematic aorist as in greek this class has different endings from all the others which partly reflect the PIE secondary endings as expected for the thematic aorist all except preterite class VI have a common set of endings that stem from the PIE perfect endings although with significant innovations imperative the imperative likewise shows classes with a unique set of endings found only in the second person and a prefix beginning with p this prefix usually reflects proto tocharian p\\u00e4 but unexpected connecting vowels occasionally occur and the prefix combines with vowel initial and glide initial roots in unexpected ways the prefix is often compared with the slavic perfective prefix po although the phonology is difficult to explain classes i through v tend to co occur with preterite classes i through v although there are many exceptions class vi is not so much a coherent class as an irregular class with all verbs not fitting in other categories the imperative classes tend to share the same suffix as the corresponding preterite if any but to have root vocalism that matches the vocalism of a verb s subjunctive this includes the root ablaut of subjunctive classes i and v which tend to co occur with imperative class i optative and imperfect the optative and imperfect have related formations the optative is generally built by adding i onto the subjunctive stem tocharian b likewise forms the imperfect by adding i onto the present indicative stem while tocharian a has separate imperfect formations usually \\u0101 is added to the subjunctive stem but occasionally to the indicative stem and sometimes either \\u0101 or s is added directly onto the root the endings differ between the two languages tocharian a uses present endings for the optative and preterite endings for the imperfect while tocharian b uses the same endings for both which are a combination of preterite and unique endings the latter used in the singular active endings as suggested by the above discussion there are a large number of sets of endings the present tense endings come in both thematic and athematic variants although they are related with the thematic endings generally reflecting a theme vowel PIE e or o plus the athematic endings there are different sets for the preterite classes i through v preterite class VI the imperative and in tocharian b in the singular active of the optative and imperfect furthermore each set of endings comes with both active and mediopassive forms the mediopassive forms are quite conservative directly reflecting the PIE variation between r in the present and i in the past most other languages with the mediopassive have generalized one of the two the present tense endings are almost completely divergent between tocharian a and b the following shows the thematic endings with their origin comparison to other indo european languages in traditional indo european studies no hypothesis of a closer genealogical relationship of the tocharian languages has been widely accepted by linguists however lexicostatistical and glottochronological approaches suggest the anatolian languages including hittite might be the closest relatives of tocharian as an example the same proto indo european root h\\u2082wrg h but not a common suffixed formation can be reconstructed to underlie the words for wheel tocharian a w\\u00e4rk\\u00e4nt tokharian b yerkwanto and hittite \\u1e2b\\u016brkis notable example most of the texts known from the

        "TF-IDF scores are a very popular and very useful method of representing a document's text. Briefly, the purpose of a TF-IDF score is to quantify the importance of each word within a document, relative to the entire collection of documents (i.e., the corpus) as a whole. TF-IDF scores are superior to simple word probability distributions because they automatically adjust for the fact that many common words tend to occur with similar frequencies in written documents, regardless of each document's topic. More specifically, the TF-IDF approach increases the weight or importance of words that appear rarely in the corpus, while decreasing the weight of words that appear frequently in the corpus."

Its western half is primarily an arterial street, named Lake City Way and Bothell Way, that follows the northern shore of Lake Washington; the eastern half is a grade-separated freeway that runs between Woodinville and Monroe. SR 522 connects several of the metropolitan area's major highways, including Interstate 5 (I-5), I-405, SR 9, and U.S. Route 2 (US 2).\\nThe present-day route of SR 522 was built in stages between 1907 and 1965, beginning with the Red Brick Road from Seattle to Bothell, then part of the Pacific Highway and later US 99. The road later became a branch of Primary State Highway 2 (PSH 2) in 1937, and was extended east to Redmond and North Bend. A branch of the Stevens Pass Highway was built to connect PSH 2 in Bothell and Monroe in 1965, and was incorporated into SR 202 after it was designated in 1964. The Bothell\\u2013Monroe highway was re-designated as part of SR 522 in 1970, leaving SR 202 on the Bothell\\u2013North Bend highway.\\nSince the late 1990s, the SR 522 corridor between Woodinville and Monroe has been partially converted to a freeway to address safety concerns and a growing population. Portions of the highway near Woodinville and Monroe were widened between 2001 and 2014, while other sections near Maltby remain two lanes wide and undivided, with improvement projects left unfunded.\\n\\n\\n== Route description ==\\n\\nSR 522, named Lake City Way within Seattle city limits, begins at an interchange with I-5 in the Roosevelt neighborhood of northern Seattle, east of Green Lake. The interchange only allows movements south towards Downtown Seattle on I-5, and includes a connection to the freeway's reversible express lane system. The highway travels northeast from the interchange, tunneling under the intersection of Roosevelt Way NE and NE 75th Street; the intersection itself is connected to SR 522 by a series of ramps to collector streets. Lake City Way continues northeast through Maple Leaf as a four-lane arterial street before turning north on its approach to Thornton Creek. After crossing the creek, the highway enters the Lake City neighborhood, passing several car dealerships. Lake City itself is a designated urban village, with mixed-use development and apartment buildings that are centered around the intersection of Lake City Way between NE 125th Street and NE 145th Street. At NE 145th Street, SR 522 intersects SR 523 and crosses into Lake Forest Park.Beyond Seattle, the highway is named Bothell Way and follows the northern shore of Lake Washington. SR 522 intersects Ballinger Way (SR 104) at the central shopping center in Lake Forest Park, and is joined by the Burke-Gilman Trail, a multi-use trail running along the lakefront on a former railroad grade. Bothell Way continues east along the northern shore of Lake Washington through the city of Kenmore, located on the mouth of the Sammamish River and home to the Kenmore Air Harbor seaplane base. SR 522 travels upriver through a narrow valley that makes a sharp turn north towards Bothell. The highway turns east and continues downhill of the city's downtown business district, staying near the Sammamish River (and the Sammamish River Trail) and intersecting Bothell Way (formerly SR 527). Leaving Bothell, SR 522 then travels around the southern edge of University of Washington Bothell campus and intersects I-405, becoming a grade-separated freeway.East of I-405, SR 522 enters Woodinville and follows Little Bear Creek as it turns north away from the city's downtown, intersecting SR 202. The freeway enters Snohomish County and intersects SR 9 south of the Brightwater sewage treatment plant. It continues through several sharp turns that follow the Eastside Rail Corridor, a former railroad grade that runs northeasterly through the predominantly rural area near Grace. In Maltby, the freeway reaches an at-grade intersection with Paradise Lake Road (SR 524) and becomes a two-lane undivided highway. SR 522 travels northeast from Maltby, intersecting Echo Lake Road in a single-point urban interchange, and crosses the Snohomish River into Monroe. Within Monroe, the highway widens to a four-lane freeway with median separation and intersects Main Street in a dogbone interchange near the Monroe Correctional Complex. SR 522 cuts across suburban housing areas in Monroe, and crosses over US 2 and the BNSF Railway near the Evergreen State Fairgrounds. The highway makes a 180-degree turn south to intersect with US 2, where it terminates; the intersection also has a direct offramp for eastbound traffic from SR 522 to eastbound US 2.The entire route of SR 522 is designated as part of the National Highway System, classifying it as important to the national economy, defense, and mobility. The State of Washington also designates the SR 522 corridor as a Highway of Statewide Significance, which includes highways that connect major communities throughout the state. The highway is the primary route for Seattle-area residents to access Stevens Pass and other parts of the Cascade Mountains. SR 522 is maintained by the Washington State Department of Transportation (WSDOT), which conducts an annual survey on the state's highways to measure traffic volume in terms of average annual daily traffic. In 2016, WSDOT calculated that 96,000 vehicles used SR 522 at its interchange with I-405 and 12,000 vehicles used it at its eastern terminus in Monroe, the highest and lowest counts along the highway, respectively.\\n\\n\\n== History ==\\n\\n\\n=== Red Brick Road ===\\n\\nLogging settlements were established on the northern shore of Lake Washington in the 1860s and 1870s, relying primarily on the water for intercity transportation. The Seattle, Lake Shore and Eastern Railway was built along the lakefront in 1888, connecting Seattle to the new towns of Bothell and Kenmore. By the 1890s, unpaved logging trails had been completed along Lake Washington and the railroad, reaching as far northeast as Maltby.Bothell businessman and good roads advocate Gerhard Ericksen successfully lobbied the Washington State Legislature to fund the construction of a road from Seattle to Bothell as a State Aid Road and Permanent Highway in 1903. The first section of the highway, traveling 7 miles (11.3 km) from Ravenna Park in Seattle to Lake Forest Park, was completed in 1907 and was pronounced by The Seattle Times as one of the \\\"finest pieces of road to be found anywhere in the United States\\\". From 1911 to 1913, the state and county government paved 4 miles (6.4 km) of the highway between Lake Forest Park and Bothell with bricks. The highway, named the Ericksen Road after its promoter and Bothell Road after the city of Bothell, was opened on January 10, 1914, in an event named the \\\"Boulevard Blowout\\\" that featured 50 automobiles traversing the entire route between Seattle and Bothell. Most of the brick road was replaced in 1934, but a section south of downtown Bothell was preserved and remains known as Red Brick Road Park.\\n\\n\\n=== Federal and state highways ===\\n\\nThe Bothell Road became part of the Pacific Highway in 1915, forming part of the highway that would continue north from Bothell towards Everett. In 1922, the original road alignment through modern-day Lake City was bypassed by the new, concrete-paved Victory Way, dedicated in the memory of World War I veterans. The Pacific Highway was incorporated into a new national highway system that was approved by the American Association of State Highway Officials on November 11, 1926, and numbered as US 99. On October 15, 1927, the North Trunk Highway was opened between Seattle and Everett, providing a shorter and more direct route that would later be designated as US 99 and the Pacific Highway. The Bothell Highway was renovated from Seattle to Lake Forest Park in 1939, including a widening to four lanes and straightening of some segments. Part of the highway in Seattle city limits was renamed to Lake City Way in 1967, after lobbying from Lake City businessmen.An unpaved extension of the Bothell Road, traveling along the Sammamish River to Woodinville, Redmond, and Fall City, was designated as a branch of the Sunset Highway (State Road 2) in 1925. The highway was later paved and incorporated into a longer branch of the Sunset Highway (re-designated as Primary State Highway 2) in 1937, running from Downtown Seattle to Fall City. The branch highway was extended to North Bend after the opening of a Sunset Highway bypass in 1941, using the former mainline road.Another branch of the Bothell Road, from Bothell to the Stevens Pass Highway (Primary State Highway 15) in Monroe, was proposed by the state good roads association in the late 1930s. In 1941, funding for this segment was rejected by the state senate, in favor of completing the highway between Everett and Monroe first. The Bothell\\u2013Monroe Cutoff was designated as a branch of Primary State Highway 15 in 1943, with a provision that the highway would be constructed after the completion of the Everett\\u2013Monroe route. The King County government also unsuccessfully lobbied in the early 1950s for a 23-mile (37 km) highway connecting Duvall to Skykomish along the Tolt River as an alternative to the Monroe cutoff. Construction of the highway was pushed back to 1961, and it was further delayed by rainy weather. The 8.2-mile-long (13.2 km) Bothell\\u2013Monroe Cutoff opened on February 10, 1965, costing $5.3 million (equivalent to $33 million in 2019 dollars) and cutting 20 minutes in travel time between Seattle and the Stevens Pass ski area.In 1963, the Washington State Legislature commissioned a new state highway numbering system to ease confusion over similarly-numbered routes. The new system debuted in 1964, initially with State Route 522 (SR 522) assigned to the branch of Primary State Highway 2 from Seattle to North Bend, and State Route 202 (SR 202) assigned to the branch of Primary State Highway 15 from Woodinville to Monroe. By 1970, SR 522 had been moved to the Bothell\\u2013Monroe Cutoff, while SR 202 was moved to the Woodinville\\u2013North Bend highway.\\n\\n\\n=== Freeway expansion and safety improvements ===\\nThe North Seattle section of the Everett\\u2013Seattle Freeway (now I-5) opened on August 28, 1963, including access to Bothell Way in the Roosevelt neighborhood. SR 522 was truncated to I-5, removing Roosevelt Way and Eastlake Avenue from the state highway system. A four-level freeway interchange with I-405 east of Bothell was completed in 1969, creating a connection between SR 522 and SR 202.In 1968, the state highway department proposed the conversion of SR 522 into a freeway bypassing Lake City Way and Bothell Way. The plan drew heavy opposition from local residents, who feared bottlenecks and a reduction in quality of life, and was removed from regional freeway plans in 1973. Freeway plans in Monroe moved forward instead, with the completion of a two-mile-long (3.2 km) bypass to the west of downtown in 1972. SR 522 was moved from its routing on Main Street to the new freeway, which terminated at US 2 and removed a railroad grade crossing from the route.Since the 1980s, population growth in Monroe and around the SR 522 has resulted in increased traffic congestion and safety issues, including a rise in accidents and crashes. The highway was originally designed for eventual conversion into a four-lane freeway, with leftover right-of-way and bridge approaches built in 1965. Between 1980 and 1995, the 10.5-mile-long (16.9 km) stretch of SR 522 between Woodinville and Monroe was the site of over 1,100 accidents and 40 deaths. SR 522 has been named as one of the most dangerous highways in the United States by Reader's Digest in 1995 and Forbes in 2007, among other lists. The rock band \\\"State Route 522\\\" formed in 1995 by local indie rock musician Jake Snider was named for the highway.In response to the crashes on SR 522, local residents organized a grassroots campaign (\\\"Citizens Rallying for a Safer Highway\\\") to petition the state for safety improvements and a highway widening. In 1993, the state legislature allocated $180 million (equivalent to $293 million in 2019 dollars) in funding towards a five-stage widening project, but the funds were transferred to the general fund at the behest of Governor Mike Lowry. The 1994 supplemental transportation budget included $2 million for engineering studies on SR 522, with construction of a four-lane freeway funded through other means. State lawmakers recommended tolling SR 522 to pay off construction bonds, but the plan was pulled back after opposition from local residents.Existing state funds were used for the first stages of the SR 522 corridor project, including the addition of median rumble strips and improved pavement markers in 1995, which helped reduce head-on collisions. The city of Monroe replaced the eastern half of SR 522 interchange with Main Street (164th Street Southeast) with a roundabout, the first to be built in Snohomish County, in 2001. The first stage of the corridor project was completed in 2001 and widened a section between SR 9 and Paradise Lake Road (SR 524) in Maltby, at a cost of $22 million. The second stage, a new single-point urban interchange at Echo Lake Road southwest of Monroe, was completed in 2006 at a cost of $37 million. The third stage of the SR 522 corridor project was completed in 2014, widening the highway to four lanes across the Snohomish River and through Monroe to US 2, where a new eastbound offramp was also constructed separately in 2012. A new roundabout at the 164th Street Southeast interchange was also opened as part of the project, completing the dogbone interchange.The remaining stages of the SR 522 corridor project between Maltby and the Snohomish River were planned to be funded by the Roads and Transit ballot measure in 2007, before it was rejected by local voters. The 2015 state transportation package included $10 million in design funding for an interchange at Paradise Lake Road in Maltby, to be made available in 2025, but construction of the interchange and widening of the remaining segment remains unfunded. The preliminary design options for the future diamond interchange would place the main ramps at either SR 524 or Paradise Lake Road. A coalition of politician and business leaders named \\\"Finish522\\\" was formed in 2018 to lobby the state government for barriers and complete grade separation in the wake of several fatal crashes in the mid-2010s. Long-term plans from WSDOT to address increasing traffic congestion in downtown Monroe include the construction of a highway bypass for US 2 to the north of the city. The project would include a northern extension of SR 522 to intersect the realigned US 2 near Kelsey Street and Chain Lake Road.\\n\\n\\n=== Mass transit ===\\n\\nThe western portion of SR 522, including Lake City Way and Bothell Way, is a major public transit corridor for the region and is served by Sound Transit Express and King County Metro bus routes. Bus lanes were added to sections of SR 522 in Seattle, Lake Forest Park, and Kenmore in the 1990s, and were expanded in the 2000s. In 2002, Sound Transit launched express Route 522, traveling between Downtown Seattle and Woodinville.Sound Transit plans to run a Stride bus rapid transit line on SR 522 from NE 145th Street to the University of Washington Bothell campus as part of its Sound Transit 3 program, approved in 2016. The line is scheduled to begin service in 2024 and will terminate at the NE 145th Street light rail station in Shoreline. The corridor has also been proposed for forms of rail transit since the mid-20th century, including the failed Forward Thrust ballot measures of 1968 and 1970, the Seattle Monorail Project, and light rail in the Sound Transit long-range plan.\\n\\n\\n== Major intersections ==\\nAll exits are unnumbered.\\n\\n\\n== References ==\\n\\n\\n== External links ==\\n\\n Media related to Washington State Route 522 at Wikimedia Commons\\nHighways of Washington State\",\n          \"The periodicity of solar eclipses is the interval between any two solar eclipses in succession, which will be either 1, 5, or 6 synodic months. It is calculated that the earth will experience a total number of 11,898 solar eclipses between 2000 BCE and 3000 CE. A particular solar eclipse will be repeated approximately after every 18 years 11 days and 8 hours (6,585.32 days) of period, but not in the same geographical region.\\nA particular geographical region will experience a particular solar eclipse in every 54 years 34 days period. Total solar eclipses are rare events, although they occur somewhere on Earth every 18 months on average,\\n\\n\\n== Repetition of solar eclipses ==\\nFor the repetition of a solar eclipse, the geometric alignment of the Earth, Moon and Sun, as well as some parameters of the lunar orbit should be repeated. The following parameters and criteria must be repeated for the repetition of a solar eclipse:\\nThe Moon must be in new phase.\\nThe longitude of perigee of the Moon must be the same.\\nThe longitude of the ascending node must be the same.\\nThe Earth will be nearly the same distance from the Sun, and tilted to it in nearly the same orientation.These conditions are related with the three periods of the Moon's orbital motion, viz. the synodic month, anomalistic month and draconic month. In other words, a particular eclipse will be repeated only if the Moon will complete roughly an integer number of synodic, draconic, and anomalistic periods (223, 242, and 239) and the Earth-Sun-Moon geometry will be nearly identical to that eclipse. The Moon will be at the same node and the same distance from the Earth. Gamma changes monotonically throughout any single Saros series. The change in gamma is larger when Earth is near its aphelion (June to July) than when it is near perihelion (December to January). When the Earth is near its average distance (March to April or September to October), the change in gamma is average. The first three conditions can be met after a time equal to the integral multiple of synodic, draconic, and anomalistic periods. The period is approximately equal to 6,585.32 days (18 years 11 days 8 hours).\\n\\n\\n== Eclipses would not occur in every month ==\\n\\nIf the Earth had a perfectly circular orbit centered around the Sun, and the Moon's orbit was also perfectly circular and centered around the Earth, and both orbits were coplanar (on the same plane) with each other, then two eclipses would happen every lunar month (29.53 days). A lunar eclipse would occur at every full moon, a solar eclipse every new moon, and all solar eclipses would be the same type. In fact the distances between the Earth and Moon and that of the Earth and the Sun vary because both the Earth and the Moon have elliptic orbits. Also, both the orbits are not on the same plane. The Moon's orbit is inclined about 5.14\\u00b0 to Earth's orbit around the Sun. So the Moon's orbit crosses the ecliptic at two points or nodes. If a New Moon takes place within about 17\\u00b0 of a node, then a solar eclipse will be visible from some location on Earth.At an average angular velocity of 0.99\\u00b0 per day, the Sun takes 34.5 days to cross the 34\\u00b0 wide eclipse zone centered on each node. Because the Moon's orbit with respect to the Sun has a mean duration of 29.53 days, there will always be one and possibly two solar eclipses during each 34.5-day interval when the Sun passes through the nodal eclipse zones. These time periods are called eclipse seasons. Either two or three eclipses happen each eclipse season. During the eclipse season, the inclination of the Moon's orbit is low, hence the Sun, Moon, and Earth become aligned straight enough (in syzygy) for an eclipse to occur.\\n\\n\\n== References ==\",\n          \"The Tocharian (sometimes Tokharian) languages ( or ), also known as Ar\\u015bi-Ku\\u010di, Agnean-Kuchean or Kuchean-Agnean, are an extinct branch of the Indo-European language family spoken by inhabitants of the Tarim Basin, the Tocharians. They are known from manuscripts dating from the 5th to the 8th century AD, which were found in oasis cities on the northern edge of the Tarim Basin (now part of Xinjiang in northwest China) and the Lop Desert. The discovery of this language family in the early 20th century contradicted the formerly prevalent idea of an east\\u2013west division of the Indo-European language family on the centum\\u2013satem isogloss, and prompted reinvigorated study of the family. Mistakenly identifying the authors with the Tokharoi people of ancient Bactria (Tokharistan), early authors called these languages \\\"Tocharian\\\". This naming has remained, although the names Agnean and Kuchean have been proposed as a replacement.The documents record two closely related languages, called Tocharian A (also East Tocharian, Agnean or Turfanian) and Tocharian B (West Tocharian or Kuchean). The subject matter of the texts suggests that Tocharian A was more archaic and used as a Buddhist liturgical language, while Tocharian B was more actively spoken in the entire area from Turfan in the east to Tumshuq in the west. A body of loanwords and names found in Prakrit documents from the Lop Nor basin have been dubbed Tocharian C (Kror\\u00e4nian). A claimed find of ten Tocharian C texts written in Kharo\\u1e63\\u1e6dh\\u012b script has been discredited.The oldest extant manuscripts in Tocharian B are now dated to the 5th or even late 4th century AD, making Tocharian a language of Late Antiquity contemporary with Gothic, Classical Armenian and Primitive Irish.\\n\\n\\n== Discovery and significance ==\\n\\nThe existence of the Tocharian languages and alphabet was not even suspected until archaeological exploration of the Tarim Basin by Aurel Stein in the early 20th century brought to light fragments of manuscripts in an unknown language, dating from the 6th to 8th centuries AD.It soon became clear that these fragments were actually written in two distinct but related languages belonging to a hitherto unknown branch of Indo-European, now known as Tocharian:\\n\\nTocharian A (Agnean or East Tocharian; natively \\u0101r\\u015bi) of Qara\\u0161\\u00e4h\\u00e4r (ancient Agni, Chinese Yanqi) and Turpan (ancient Turfan and Xo\\u010do), and\\nTocharian B (Kuchean or West Tocharian) of Kucha and Tocharian A sites.\\nPrakrit documents from 3rd-century Kror\\u00e4n and Niya on the southeast edge of the Tarim Basin contain loanwords and names that appear to come from a closely related language, referred to as Tocharian C.The discovery of Tocharian upset some theories about the relations of Indo-European languages and revitalized their study. In the 19th century, it was thought that the division between centum and satem languages was a simple west\\u2013east division, with centum languages in the west. The theory was undermined in the early 20th century by the discovery of Hittite, a centum language in a relatively eastern location, and Tocharian, which was a centum language despite being the easternmost branch. The result was a new hypothesis, following the wave model of Johannes Schmidt, suggesting that the satem isogloss represents a linguistic innovation in the central part of the Proto-Indo-European home range, and the centum languages along the eastern and the western peripheries did not undergo that change.Most scholars reject Walter Bruno Henning's proposed link to Gutian, a language spoken on the Iranian plateau in the 22nd century BC and known only from personal names.Tocharian probably died out after 840 when the Uyghurs, expelled from Mongolia by the Kyrgyz, moved into the Tarim Basin. The theory is supported by the discovery of translations of Tocharian texts into Uyghur.\\nSome modern Chinese words may ultimately derive from a Tocharian or related source, e.g. Old Chinese *mjit (\\u871c; m\\u00ec) \\\"honey\\\", from proto-Tocharian *\\u1e3f\\u0259t(\\u0259) (where *\\u1e3f is palatalized; cf. Tocharian B mit), cognate with English mead.\\n\\n\\n== Names ==\\n\\nA colophon to a Buddhist manuscript in Old Turkish from 800 AD states that it was translated from Sanskrit via a tw\\u03b3ry language.  In 1907, Emil Sieg and Friedrich W. K. M\\u00fcller guessed that this referred to the newly discovered language of the Turpan area.\\nSieg and M\\u00fcller, reading this name as toxr\\u00ef, connected it with the ethnonym T\\u00f3charoi (Ancient Greek: \\u03a4\\u03cc\\u03c7\\u03b1\\u03c1\\u03bf\\u03b9, Ptolemy VI, 11, 6, 2nd century AD), itself taken from Indo-Iranian (cf. Old Persian tux\\u0101ri-, Khotanese ttahv\\u0101ra, and Sanskrit tukh\\u0101ra), and proposed the name \\\"Tocharian\\\" (German Tocharisch).  Ptolemy's T\\u00f3charoi are often associated by modern scholars with the Yuezhi of Chinese historical accounts, who founded the Kushan empire. It is now clear that these people actually spoke Bactrian, an Eastern Iranian language, rather than the language of the Tarim manuscripts, so the term \\\"Tocharian\\\" is considered a misnomer.Nevertheless, it remains the standard term for the language of the Tarim Basin manuscripts.In 1938, Walter Henning found the term \\\"four tw\\u03b3ry\\\" used in early 9th-century manuscripts in Sogdian, Middle Iranian and Uighur.  He argued that it referred to the region on the northeast edge of the Tarim, including Agni and Karakhoja but not Kucha.  He thus inferred that the colophon referred to the Agnean language.Although the term tw\\u03b3ry or toxr\\u00ef appears to be the Old Turkic name for the Tocharians, it is not found in Tocharian texts.\\nThe apparent self-designation \\u0101r\\u015bi appears in Tocharian A texts. Tocharian B texts use the adjective ku\\u015bi\\u00f1\\u00f1e, derived from ku\\u015bi or ku\\u010di, a name also known from Chinese and Turkic documents. The historian Bernard Sergent compounded these names to coin an alternative term Ar\\u015bi-Ku\\u010di for the family, recently revised to Agni-Ku\\u010di, but this name has not achieved widespread usage.\\n\\n\\n== Writing system ==\\n\\nTocharian is documented in manuscript fragments, mostly from the 8th century (with a few earlier ones) that were written on palm leaves, wooden tablets and Chinese paper, preserved by the extremely dry climate of the Tarim Basin. Samples of the language have been discovered at sites in Kucha and Karasahr, including many mural inscriptions.\\nMost of attested Tocharian was written in the Tocharian alphabet, a derivative of the Brahmi alphabetic syllabary (abugida) also referred to as North Turkestan Brahmi or slanting Brahmi. However a smaller amount was written in the Manichaean script in which Manichaean texts were recorded. It soon became apparent that a large proportion of the manuscripts were translations of known Buddhist works in Sanskrit and some of them were even bilingual, facilitating decipherment of the new language. Besides the Buddhist and Manichaean religious texts, there were also monastery correspondence and accounts, commercial documents, caravan permits, medical and magical texts, and one love poem.\\nIn 1998, Chinese linguist Ji Xianlin published a translation and analysis of fragments of a Tocharian Maitreyasamiti-Nataka discovered in 1974 in Yanqi.\\n\\n\\n== Tocharian A and B ==\\n\\nTocharian A and B are significantly different, to the point of being mutually unintelligible.  A common Proto-Tocharian language must precede the attested languages by several centuries, probably dating to the late 1st millennium BC.Tocharian A is found only in the eastern part of the Tocharian-speaking area, and all extant texts are of a religious nature.  Tocharian B, however, is found throughout the range and in both religious and secular texts.  As a result, it has been suggested that Tocharian A was a liturgical language, no longer spoken natively, while Tocharian B was the spoken language of the entire area. On the other hand, it is possible that the lack of a secular corpus in Tocharian A is simply an accident, due to the smaller distribution of the language and the fragmentary preservation of Tocharian texts in general.The hypothesized relationship of Tocharian A and B as liturgical and spoken forms, respectively, is sometimes compared with the relationship between Latin and the modern Romance languages, or Classical Chinese and Mandarin. However, in both of these latter cases the liturgical language is the linguistic ancestor of the spoken language, whereas no such relationship holds between Tocharian A and B.  In fact, from a phonological perspective Tocharian B is significantly more conservative than Tocharian A, and serves as the primary source for reconstructing Proto-Tocharian. Only Tocharian B preserves the following Proto-Tocharian features: stress distinctions, final vowels, diphthongs, and o vs. e distinction. In turn, the loss of final vowels in Tocharian A has led to the loss of certain Proto-Tocharian categories still found in Tocharian B, e.g. the vocative case and some of the noun, verb and adjective declensional classes.\\nIn their declensional and conjugational endings, the two languages innovated in divergent ways, with neither clearly simpler than the other.  For example, both languages show significant innovations in the present active indicative endings but in radically different ways, so that only the second-person singular ending is directly cognate between the two languages, and in most cases neither variant is directly cognate with the corresponding Proto-Indo-European (PIE) form.  The agglutinative secondary case endings in the two languages likewise stem from different sources, showing parallel development of the secondary case system after the Proto-Tocharian period.  Likewise, some of the verb classes show independent origins, e.g. the class II preterite, which uses reduplication in Tocharian A (possibly from the reduplicated aorist) but long PIE \\u0113 in Tocharian B (possibly related to the long-vowel perfect found in Latin l\\u0113g\\u012b, f\\u0113c\\u012b, etc.).Tocharian B shows an internal chronological development; three linguistic stages have been detected. The oldest stage is attested only in Kucha. There are also the middle ('classical\\u02bc), and the late stage.\\n\\n\\n== Tocharian C ==\\nBased on 3rd-century Loulan G\\u0101ndh\\u0101r\\u012b Prakrit documents containing Tocharian loanwords such as kilme 'district', \\u1e63o\\u1e63tha\\u1e43ga 'tax collector', and \\u1e63ilpoga 'document', T. Burrow suggested in the 1930s the existence of a third Tocharian language, which has been labelled Tocharian C or \\\"Kror\\u00e4nian\\\", \\\"Krorainic\\\", or \\\"Lolanisch\\\".In 2018, ten texts written in the Kharo\\u1e63\\u1e6dh\\u012b alphabet from Loulan were published and analyzed in the posthumous papers of Tocharologist Klaus T. Schmidt as being written in Tocharian C.  Schmidt suggested that the language was closer to Tocharian B than to Tocharian A. On September 15 and 16, 2019, a group of linguists led by Georges Pinault and Micha\\u00ebl Peyrot met in Leiden to examine Schmidt's transcriptions and the original texts, and concluded they had all been transcribed entirely incorrectly. Their conclusions appear to have discredited Schmidt's Tocharian C claims.\\n\\n\\n== Phonology ==\\n\\nPhonetically, Tocharian languages are \\\"centum\\\" Indo-European languages, meaning that they merge the palatovelar consonants (*\\u1e31, *\\u01f5, *\\u01f5\\u02b0) of Proto Indo-European with the plain velars (*k, *g, *g\\u02b0) rather than palatalizing them to affricates or sibilants. Centum languages are mostly found in western and southern Europe (Greek, Italic, Celtic, Germanic). In that sense, Tocharian (to some extent like the Greek and the Anatolian languages) seems to have been an isolate in the \\\"satem\\\" (i.e. palatovelar to sibilant) phonetic regions of Indo-European-speaking populations. The discovery of Tocharian contributed to doubts that Proto-Indo-European had originally split into western and eastern branches; today, the centum\\u2013satem division is not seen as a real familial division.\\n\\n\\n=== Vowels ===\\nTocharian A and Tocharian B have the same set of vowels, but they often do not correspond to each other.  For example, the sound a did not occur in Proto-Tocharian. Tocharian B a  is derived from former stressed \\u00e4 or unstressed \\u0101 (reflected unchanged in Tocharian A), while Tocharian A a stems from Proto-Tocharian /\\u025b/ or /\\u0254/ (reflected as /e/ and /o/ in Tocharian B), and Tocharian A e and o stem largely from monophthongization of former diphthongs (still present in Tocharian B).\\n\\n\\n=== Diphthongs ===\\nDiphthongs occur in Tocharian B only.\\n\\n\\n=== Consonants ===\\n\\nThe following table lists the reconstructed phonemes in Tocharian along with their standard transcription.  Because Tocharian is written in an alphabet used originally for Sanskrit and its descendants, the transcription of the sounds is directly based on the transcription of the corresponding Sanskrit sounds.  The Tocharian alphabet also has letters representing all of the remaining Sanskrit sounds, but these appear only in Sanskrit loanwords and are not thought to have had distinct pronunciations in Tocharian.  There is some uncertainty as to actual pronunciation of some of the letters, particularly those representing palatalized obstruents (see below).\\n\\n/n/ is transcribed by two different letters in the Tocharian alphabet depending on position.  Based on the corresponding letters in Sanskrit, these are transcribed \\u1e43 (word-finally, including before certain clitics) and n (elsewhere), but \\u1e43 represents /n/, not /m/.\\nThe sound written c is thought to correspond to a palatal stop /c/ in Sanskrit.  The Tocharian pronunciation /t\\u0255/ is suggested by the common occurrence of the cluster \\u015bc, but the exact pronunciation cannot be determined with certainty.\\nThe sound written \\u1e63 corresponds to retroflex sibilant /\\u0282/ in Sanskrit, but it seems more likely to have been a palato-alveolar sibilant /\\u0283/ (as in English \\\"ship\\\"), because it derives from a palatalized /s/.\\nThe sound \\u1e45 /\\u014b/ occurs only before k, or in some clusters where a k has been deleted between consonants. It is clearly phonemic because sequences nk and \\u00f1k also exist (from syncope of a former \\u00e4 between them).\\n\\n\\n== Morphology ==\\n\\n\\n=== Nouns ===\\nTocharian has completely re-worked the nominal declension system of Proto-Indo-European. The only cases inherited from the proto-language are nominative, genitive, accusative, and (in Tocharian B only) vocative; in Tocharian the old accusative is known as the oblique case. In addition to these primary cases, however, each Tocharian language has six cases formed by the addition of an invariant suffix to the oblique case \\u2014 although the set of six cases is not the same in each language, and the suffixes are largely non-cognate. For example, the Tocharian word yakwe (Toch B), yuk (Toch A) \\\"horse\\\" < PIE *e\\u1e31wos is declined as follows:\\nThe Tocharian A instrumental case rarely occurs with humans.\\nWhen referring to humans, the oblique singular of most adjectives and of some nouns is marked in both varieties by an ending -(a)\\u1e43, which also appears in the secondary cases.  An example is e\\u1e45kwe (Toch B), o\\u1e45k (Toch A) \\\"man\\\", which belongs to the same declension as above, but has oblique singular e\\u1e45kwe\\u1e43 (Toch B), o\\u1e45ka\\u1e43 (Toch A), and corresponding oblique stems e\\u1e45kwe\\u1e43- (Toch B), o\\u1e45kn- (Toch A) for the secondary cases.  This is thought to stem from the generalization of n-stem adjectives as an indication of determinative semantics, seen most prominently in the weak adjective declension in the Germanic languages (where it cooccurs with definite articles and determiners), but also in Latin and Greek n-stem nouns (especially proper names) formed from adjectives, e.g. Latin Cat\\u014d (genitive Cat\\u014dnis) literally \\\"the sly one\\\" < catus \\\"sly\\\", Greek Pl\\u00e1t\\u014dn literally \\\"the broad-shouldered one\\\" < plat\\u00fas \\\"broad\\\".\\n\\n\\n=== Verbs ===\\n\\nIn contrast, the verb verbal conjugation system is quite conservative. The majority of Proto-Indo-European verbal classes and categories are represented in some manner in Tocharian, although not necessarily with the same function. Some examples: athematic and thematic present tenses, including null-, -y-, -s\\u1e31-, -s-, -n- and -nH- suffixes as well as n-infixes and various laryngeal-ending stems; o-grade and possibly lengthened-grade perfects (although lacking reduplication or augment); sigmatic, reduplicated, thematic and possibly lengthened-grade aorists; optatives; imperatives; and possibly PIE subjunctives.\\nIn addition, most PIE sets of endings are found in some form in Tocharian (although with significant innovations), including thematic and athematic endings, primary (non-past) and secondary (past) endings, active and mediopassive endings, and perfect endings.  Dual endings are still found, although they are rarely attested and generally restricted to the third person. The mediopassive still reflects the distinction between primary -r and secondary -i, effaced in most Indo-European languages.  Both root and suffix ablaut is still well-represented, although again with significant innovations.\\n\\n\\n==== Categories ====\\nTocharian verbs are conjugated in the following categories:\\nMood: indicative, subjunctive, optative, imperative.\\nTense/aspect (in the indicative only): present, preterite, imperfect.\\nVoice: active, mediopassive, deponent.\\nPerson: 1st, 2nd, 3rd.\\nNumber: singular, dual, plural.\\nCausation: basic, causative.\\nNon-finite: active participle, mediopassive participle, present gerundive, subjunctive gerundive.\\n\\n\\n==== Classes ====\\nA given verb belongs to one of a large number of classes, according to its conjugation.  As in Sanskrit, Ancient Greek and (to a lesser extent) Latin, there are independent sets of classes in the indicative present, subjunctive, perfect, imperative, and to a limited extent optative and imperfect, and there is no general correspondence among the different sets of classes, meaning that each verb must be specified using a number of principal parts.\\n\\n\\n===== Present indicative =====\\nThe most complex system is the present indicative, consisting of 12 classes, 8 thematic and 4 athematic, with distinct sets of thematic and athematic endings.  The following classes occur in Tocharian B (some are missing in Tocharian A):\\n\\nI: Athematic without suffix < PIE root athematic.\\nII: Thematic without suffix < PIE root thematic.\\nIII: Thematic with PToch suffix *-\\u00eb-. Mediopassive only.  Apparently reflecting consistent PIE o theme rather than the normal alternating o/e theme.\\nIV: Thematic with PToch suffix *-\\u0254-. Mediopassive only.  Same PIE origin as previous class, but diverging within Proto-Tocharian.\\nV: Athematic with PToch suffix *-\\u0101-, likely from either PIE verbs ending in a syllabic laryngeal or PIE derived verbs in *-eh\\u2082- (but extended to other verbs).\\nVI: Athematic with PToch suffix *-n\\u0101-, from PIE verbs in *-nH-.\\nVII: Athematic with infixed nasal, from PIE infixed nasal verbs.\\nVIII: Thematic with suffix -s-, possibly from PIE -s\\u1e31-?\\nIX: Thematic with suffix -sk- < PIE -s\\u1e31-.\\nX: Thematic with PToch suffix *-n\\u00e4sk/n\\u0101sk- (evidently a combination of classes VI and IX).\\nXI: Thematic in PToch suffix *-s\\u00e4sk- (evidently a combination of classes VIII and IX).\\nXII: Thematic with PToch suffix *-(\\u00e4)\\u00f1\\u00f1- < either PIE *-n-y- (denominative to n-stem nouns) or PIE *-nH-y- (deverbative from PIE *-nH- verbs).Palatalization of the final root consonant occurs in the 2nd singular, 3rd singular, 3rd dual and 2nd plural in thematic classes II and VIII-XII as a result of the original PIE thematic vowel e.\\n\\n\\n===== Subjunctive =====\\nThe subjunctive likewise has 12 classes, denoted i through xii.  Most are conjugated identically to the corresponding indicative classes; indicative and subjunctive are distinguished by the fact that a verb in a given indicative class will usually belong to a different subjunctive class.\\nIn addition, four subjunctive classes differ from the corresponding indicative classes, two \\\"special subjunctive\\\" classes with differing suffixes and two \\\"varying subjunctive\\\" classes with root ablaut reflecting the PIE perfect.\\nSpecial subjunctives:\\n\\niv: Thematic with suffix i < PIE -y-, with consistent palatalization of final root consonant.  Tocharian B only, rare.\\nvii: Thematic (not athematic, as in indicative class VII) with suffix \\u00f1 < PIE -n- (palatalized by thematic e, with palatalized variant generalized).Varying subjunctives:\\n\\ni: Athematic without suffix, with root ablaut reflecting PIE o-grade in active singular, zero-grade elsewhere.  Derived from PIE perfect.\\nv: Identical to class i but with PToch suffix *-\\u0101-, originally reflecting laryngeal-final roots but generalized.\\n\\n\\n===== Preterite =====\\nThe preterite has 6 classes:\\n\\nI: The most common class, with a suffix \\u0101 < PIE \\u1e24 (i.e. roots ending in a laryngeal, although widely extended to other roots).  This class shows root ablaut, with original e-grade (and palatalization of the initial root consonant) in the active singular, contrasting with zero-grade (and no palatalization) elsewhere.\\nII: This class has reduplication in Tocharian A (possibly reflecting the PIE reduplicated aorist).  However, Tocharian B has a vowel reflecting long PIE \\u0113, along with palatalization of the initial root consonant.  There is no ablaut in this class.\\nIII: This class has a suffix s in the 3rd singular active and throughout the mediopassive, evidently reflecting the PIE sigmatic aorist.  Root ablaut occurs between active and mediopassive.  A few verbs have palatalization in the active along with s in the 3rd singular, but no palatalization and no s in the mediopassive, along with no root ablaut (the vowel reflects PToch \\u00eb).  This suggests that, for these verbs in particular, the active originates in the PIE sigmatic aorist (with s suffix and \\u0113 vocalism) while the mediopassive stems from the PIE perfect (with o vocalism).\\nIV: This class has suffix \\u1e63\\u1e63\\u0101, with no ablaut.  Most verbs in this class are causatives.\\nV: This class has suffix \\u00f1(\\u00f1)\\u0101, with no ablaut.  Only a few verbs belong to this class.\\nVI: This class, which has only two verbs, is derived from the PIE thematic aorist.  As in Greek, this class has different endings from all the others, which partly reflect the PIE secondary endings (as expected for the thematic aorist).All except preterite class VI have a common set of endings that stem from the PIE perfect endings, although with significant innovations.\\n\\n\\n===== Imperative =====\\nThe imperative likewise shows 6 classes, with a unique set of endings, found only in the second person, and a prefix beginning with p-.  This prefix usually reflects Proto-Tocharian *p\\u00e4- but unexpected connecting vowels occasionally occur, and the prefix combines with vowel-initial and glide-initial roots in unexpected ways.  The prefix is often compared with the Slavic perfective prefix po-, although the phonology is difficult to explain.\\nClasses i through v tend to co-occur with preterite classes I through V, although there are many exceptions.  Class vi is not so much a coherent class as an \\\"irregular\\\" class with all verbs not fitting in other categories.  The imperative classes tend to share the same suffix as the corresponding preterite (if any), but to have root vocalism that matches the vocalism of a verb's subjunctive.  This includes the root ablaut of subjunctive classes i and v, which tend to co-occur with imperative class i.\\n\\n\\n===== Optative and imperfect =====\\nThe optative and imperfect have related formations. The optative is generally built by adding i onto the subjunctive stem.  Tocharian B likewise forms the imperfect by adding i onto the present indicative stem, while Tocharian A has 4 separate imperfect formations: usually \\u0101 is added to the subjunctive stem, but occasionally to the indicative stem, and sometimes either \\u0101 or s is added directly onto the root.  The endings differ between the two languages: Tocharian A uses present endings for the optative and preterite endings for the imperfect, while Tocharian B uses the same endings for both, which are a combination of preterite and unique endings (the latter used in the singular active).\\n\\n\\n==== Endings ====\\nAs suggested by the above discussion, there are a large number of sets of endings.  The present-tense endings come in both thematic and athematic variants, although they are related, with the thematic endings generally reflecting a theme vowel (PIE e or o) plus the athematic endings.  There are different sets for the preterite classes I through V; preterite class VI; the imperative; and in Tocharian B, in the singular active of the optative and imperfect.  Furthermore, each set of endings comes with both active and mediopassive forms.  The mediopassive forms are quite conservative, directly reflecting the PIE variation between -r in the present and -i in the past. (Most other languages with the mediopassive have generalized one of the two.)\\nThe present-tense endings are almost completely divergent between Tocharian A and B.  The following shows the thematic endings, with their origin:\\n\\n\\n== Comparison to other Indo-European languages ==\\n\\nIn traditional Indo-European studies, no hypothesis of a closer genealogical relationship of the Tocharian languages has been widely accepted by linguists. However, lexicostatistical and glottochronological approaches suggest the Anatolian languages, including Hittite, might be the closest relatives of Tocharian.\\nAs an example, the same Proto-Indo-European root *h\\u2082wrg(h)- (but not a common suffixed formation) can be reconstructed to underlie the words for 'wheel': Tocharian A w\\u00e4rk\\u00e4nt, Tokharian B yerkwanto and Hittite \\u1e2b\\u016brkis.\\n\\n\\n== Notable example ==\\nMost of the texts known from the Tocharians are religious, but one noted text is a fragment of a love poem in Tocharian B (manuscript B-496, found in Kizil):\\n\\n\\n== See also ==\\nLanguage families and languages\\nTocharians\\nTocharian and Indo-European Studies (journal)\\n\\n\\n== References ==\\n\\n\\n=== Citations ===\\n\\n\\n=== Sources ===\\n\\n\\n== Further reading ==\\nLubotsky A.M.

the seattle metropolitan area approximately miles km long it connects the city of seattle to the northeastern suburbs of kenmore bothell woodinville and monroe its western half is primarily an arterial street named lake city way and bothell way that follows the northern shore of lake washington the eastern half is a grade separated freeway that runs between woodinville and monroe SR connects several of the metropolitan area s major highways including interstate i i SR and US route US the present day route of SR was built in stages between and beginning with the red brick road from seattle to bothell then part of the pacific highway and later US the road later became a branch of primary state highway PSH in and was extended east to redmond and north bend a branch of the stevens pass highway was built to connect PSH in bothell and monroe in and was incorporated into SR after it was designated in the bothell monroe highway was re designated as part of SR in leaving SR on the bothell north bend highway since the late s the SR corridor between woodinville and monroe has been partially converted to a freeway to address safety concerns and a growing population portions of the highway near woodinville and monroe were widened between and while other sections near maltby remain two lanes wide and undivided with improvement projects left unfunded route description SR named lake city way within seattle city limits begins at an interchange with i in the roosevelt neighborhood of northern seattle east of green lake the interchange only allows movements south towards downtown seattle on i and includes a connection to the freeway s reversible express lane system the highway travels northeast from the interchange tunneling under the intersection of roosevelt way NE and NE th street the intersection itself is connected to SR by a series of ramps to collector streets lake city way continues northeast through maple leaf as a four lane arterial street before turning north on its approach to thornton creek after crossing the creek the highway enters the lake city neighborhood passing several car dealerships lake city itself is a designated urban village with mixed use development and apartment buildings that are centered around the intersection of lake city way between NE th street and NE th street at NE th street SR intersects SR and crosses into lake forest park beyond seattle the highway is named bothell way and follows the northern shore of lake washington SR intersects ballinger way SR at the central shopping center in lake forest park and is joined by the burke gilman trail a multi use trail running along the lakefront on a former railroad grade bothell way continues east along the northern shore of lake washington through the city of kenmore located on the mouth of the sammamish river and home to the kenmore air harbor seaplane base SR travels upriver through a narrow valley that makes a sharp turn north towards bothell the highway turns east and continues downhill of the city s downtown business district staying near the sammamish river and the sammamish river trail and intersecting bothell way formerly SR leaving bothell SR then travels around the southern edge of university of washington bothell campus and intersects i becoming a grade separated freeway east of i SR enters woodinville and follows little bear creek as it turns north away from the city s downtown intersecting SR the freeway enters snohomish county and intersects SR south of the brightwater sewage treatment plant it continues through several sharp turns that follow the eastside rail corridor a former railroad grade that runs northeasterly through the predominantly rural area near grace in maltby the freeway reaches an at grade intersection with paradise lake road SR and becomes a two lane undivided highway SR travels northeast from maltby intersecting echo lake road in a single point urban interchange and crosses the snohomish river into monroe within monroe the highway widens to a four lane freeway with median separation and intersects main street in a dogbone interchange near the monroe correctional complex SR cuts across suburban housing areas in monroe and crosses over US and the BNSF railway near the evergreen state fairgrounds the highway makes a degree turn south to intersect with US where it terminates the intersection also has a direct offramp for eastbound traffic from SR to eastbound US the entire route of SR is designated as part of the national highway system classifying it as important to the national economy defense and mobility the state of washington also designates the SR corridor as a highway of statewide significance which includes highways that connect major communities throughout the state the highway is the primary route for seattle area residents to access stevens pass and other parts of the cascade mountains SR is maintained by the washington state department of transportation WSDOT which conducts an annual survey on the state s highways to measure traffic volume in terms of average annual daily traffic in WSDOT calculated that vehicles used SR at its interchange with i and vehicles used it at its eastern terminus in monroe the highest and lowest counts along the highway respectively history red brick road logging settlements were established on the northern shore of lake washington in the s and s relying primarily on the water for intercity transportation the seattle lake shore and eastern railway was built along the lakefront in connecting seattle to the new towns of bothell and kenmore by the s unpaved logging trails had been completed along lake washington and the railroad reaching as far northeast as maltby bothell businessman and good roads advocate gerhard ericksen successfully lobbied the washington state legislature to fund the construction of a road from seattle to bothell as a state aid road and permanent highway in the first section of the highway traveling miles km from ravenna park in seattle to lake forest park was completed in and was pronounced by the seattle times as one of the finest pieces of road to be found anywhere in the united states from to the state and county government paved miles km of the highway between lake forest park and bothell with bricks the highway named the ericksen road after its promoter and bothell road after the city of bothell was opened on january in an event named the boulevard blowout that featured automobiles traversing the entire route between seattle and bothell most of the brick road was replaced in but a section south of downtown bothell was preserved and remains known as red brick road park federal and state highways the bothell road became part of the pacific highway in forming part of the highway that would continue north from bothell towards everett in the original road alignment through modern day lake city was bypassed by the new concrete paved victory way dedicated in the memory of world war i veterans the pacific highway was incorporated into a new national highway system that was approved by the american association of state highway officials on november and numbered as US on october the north trunk highway was opened between seattle and everett providing a shorter and more direct route that would later be designated as US and the pacific highway the bothell highway was renovated from seattle to lake forest park in including a widening to four lanes and straightening of some segments part of the highway in seattle city limits was renamed to lake city way in after lobbying from lake city businessmen an unpaved extension of the bothell road traveling along the sammamish river to woodinville redmond and fall city was designated as a branch of the sunset highway state road in the highway was later paved and incorporated into a longer branch of the sunset highway re designated as primary state highway in running from downtown seattle to fall city the branch highway was extended to north bend after the opening of a sunset highway bypass in using the former mainline road another branch of the bothell road from bothell to the stevens pass highway primary state highway in monroe was proposed by the state good roads association in the late s in funding for this segment was rejected by the state senate in favor of completing the highway between everett and monroe first the bothell monroe cutoff was designated as a branch of primary state highway in with a provision that the highway would be constructed after the completion of the everett monroe route the king county government also unsuccessfully lobbied in the early s for a mile km highway connecting duvall to skykomish along the tolt river as an alternative to the monroe cutoff construction of the highway was pushed back to and it was further delayed by rainy weather the mile long km bothell monroe cutoff opened on february costing million equivalent to million in dollars and cutting minutes in travel time between seattle and the stevens pass ski area in the washington state legislature commissioned a new state highway numbering system to ease confusion over similarly numbered routes the new system debuted in initially with state route SR assigned to the branch of primary state highway from seattle to north bend and state route SR assigned to the branch of primary state highway from woodinville to monroe by SR had been moved to the bothell monroe cutoff while SR was moved to the woodinville north bend highway freeway expansion and safety improvements the north seattle section of the everett seattle freeway now i opened on august including access to bothell way in the roosevelt neighborhood SR was truncated to i removing roosevelt way and eastlake avenue from the state highway system a four level freeway interchange with i east of bothell was completed in creating a connection between SR and SR in the state highway department proposed the conversion of SR into a freeway bypassing lake city way and bothell way the plan drew heavy opposition from local residents who feared bottlenecks and a reduction in quality of life and was removed from regional freeway plans in freeway plans in monroe moved forward instead with the completion of a two mile long km bypass to the west of downtown in SR was moved from its routing on main street to the new freeway which terminated at US and removed a railroad grade crossing from the route since the s population growth in monroe and around the SR has resulted in increased traffic congestion and safety issues including a rise in accidents and crashes the highway was originally designed for eventual conversion into a four lane freeway with leftover right of way and bridge approaches built in between and the mile long km stretch of SR between woodinville and monroe was the site of over accidents and deaths SR has been named as one of the most dangerous highways in the united states by reader s digest in and forbes in among other lists the rock band state route formed in by local indie rock musician jake snider was named for the highway in response to the crashes on SR local residents organized a grassroots campaign citizens rallying for a safer highway to petition the state for safety improvements and a highway widening in the state legislature allocated million equivalent to million in dollars in funding towards a five stage widening project but the funds were transferred to the general fund at the behest of governor mike lowry the supplemental transportation budget included million for engineering studies on SR with construction of a four lane freeway funded through other means state lawmakers recommended tolling SR to pay off construction bonds but the plan was pulled back after opposition from local residents existing state funds were used for the first stages of the SR corridor project including the addition of median rumble strips and improved pavement markers in which helped reduce head on collisions the city of monroe replaced the eastern half of SR interchange with main street th street southeast with a roundabout the first to be built in snohomish county in the first stage of the corridor project was completed in and widened a section between SR and paradise lake road SR in maltby at a cost of million the second stage a new single point urban interchange at echo lake road southwest of monroe was completed in at a cost of million the third stage of the SR corridor project was completed in widening the highway to four lanes across the snohomish river and through monroe to US where a new eastbound offramp was also constructed separately in a new roundabout at the th street southeast interchange was also opened as part of the project completing the dogbone interchange the remaining stages of the SR corridor project between maltby and the snohomish river were planned to be funded by the roads and transit ballot measure in before it was rejected by local voters the state transportation package included million in design funding for an interchange at paradise lake road in maltby to be made available in but construction of the interchange and widening of the remaining segment remains unfunded the preliminary design options for the future diamond interchange would place the main ramps at either SR or paradise lake road a coalition of politician and business leaders named finish was formed in to lobby the state government for barriers and complete grade separation in the wake of several fatal crashes in the mid s long term plans from WSDOT to address increasing traffic congestion in downtown monroe include the construction of a highway bypass for US to the north of the city the project would include a northern extension of SR to intersect the realigned US near kelsey street and chain lake road mass transit the western portion of SR including lake city way and bothell way is a major public transit corridor for the region and is served by sound transit express and king county metro bus routes bus lanes were added to sections of SR in seattle lake forest park and kenmore in the s and were expanded in the s in sound transit launched express route traveling between downtown seattle and woodinville sound transit plans to run a stride bus rapid transit line on SR from NE th street to the university of washington bothell campus as part of its sound transit program approved in the line is scheduled to begin service in and will terminate at the NE th street light rail station in

repeated the following parameters and criteria must be repeated for the repetition of a solar eclipse the moon must be in new phase the longitude of perigee of the moon must be the same the longitude of the ascending node must be the same the earth will be nearly the same distance from the sun and tilted to it in nearly the same orientation these conditions are related with the three periods of the moon s orbital motion viz the synodic month anomalistic month and draconic month in other words a particular eclipse will be repeated only if the moon will complete roughly an integer number of synodic draconic and anomalistic periods and and the earth sun moon geometry will be nearly identical to that eclipse the moon will be at the same node and the same distance from the earth gamma changes monotonically throughout any single saros series the change in gamma is larger when earth is near its aphelion june to july than when it is near perihelion december to january when the earth is near its average distance march to april or september to october the change in gamma is average the first three conditions can be met after a time equal to the integral multiple of synodic draconic and anomalistic periods the period is approximately equal to days years days hours eclipses would not occur in every month if the earth had a perfectly circular orbit centered around the sun and the moon s orbit was also perfectly circular and centered around the earth and both orbits were coplanar on the same plane with each other then two eclipses would happen every lunar month days a lunar eclipse would occur at every full moon a solar eclipse every new moon and all solar eclipses would be the same type in fact the distances between the earth and moon and that of the earth and the sun vary because both the earth and the moon have elliptic orbits also both the orbits are not on the same plane the moon s orbit is inclined about to earth s orbit around the sun so the moon s orbit crosses the ecliptic at two points or nodes if a new moon takes place within about of a node then a solar eclipse will be visible from some location on earth at an average angular velocity of per day the sun takes days to cross the wide eclipse zone centered on each node because the moon s orbit with respect to the sun has a mean duration of days there will always be one and possibly two solar eclipses during each day interval when the sun passes through the nodal eclipse zones these time periods are called eclipse seasons either two or three eclipses happen each eclipse season during the eclipse season the inclination of the moon s orbit is low hence the sun moon and earth become aligned straight enough in syzygy for an eclipse to occur references\",\n          \"the tocharian sometimes tokharian languages or also known as ar\\u015bi ku\\u010di agnean kuchean or kuchean agnean are an extinct branch of the indo european language family spoken by inhabitants of the tarim basin the tocharians they are known from manuscripts dating from the th to the th century AD which were found in oasis cities on the northern edge of the tarim basin now part of xinjiang in northwest china and the lop desert the discovery of this language family in the early th century contradicted the formerly prevalent idea of an east west division of the indo european language family on the centum satem isogloss and prompted reinvigorated study of the family mistakenly identifying the authors with the tokharoi people of ancient bactria tokharistan early authors called these languages tocharian this naming has remained although the names agnean and kuchean have been proposed as a replacement the documents record two closely related languages called tocharian a also east tocharian agnean or turfanian and tocharian b west tocharian or kuchean the subject matter of the texts suggests that tocharian a was more archaic and used as a buddhist liturgical language while tocharian b was more actively spoken in the entire area from turfan in the east to tumshuq in the west a body of loanwords and names found in prakrit documents from the lop nor basin have been dubbed tocharian c kror\\u00e4nian a claimed find of ten tocharian c texts written in kharo\\u1e63\\u1e6dh\\u012b script has been discredited the oldest extant manuscripts in tocharian b are now dated to the th or even late th century AD making tocharian a language of late antiquity contemporary with gothic classical armenian and primitive irish discovery and significance the existence of the tocharian languages and alphabet was not even suspected until archaeological exploration of the tarim basin by aurel stein in the early th century brought to light fragments of manuscripts in an unknown language dating from the th to th centuries AD it soon became clear that these fragments were actually written in two distinct but related languages belonging to a hitherto unknown branch of indo european now known as tocharian tocharian a agnean or east tocharian natively \\u0101r\\u015bi of qara\\u0161\\u00e4h\\u00e4r ancient agni chinese yanqi and turpan ancient turfan and xo\\u010do and tocharian b kuchean or west tocharian of kucha and tocharian a sites prakrit documents from rd century kror\\u00e4n and niya on the southeast edge of the tarim basin contain loanwords and names that appear to come from a closely related language referred to as tocharian c the discovery of tocharian upset some theories about the relations of indo european languages and revitalized their study in the th century it was thought that the division between centum and satem languages was a simple west east division with centum languages in the west the theory was undermined in the early th century by the discovery of hittite a centum language in a relatively eastern location and tocharian which was a centum language despite being the easternmost branch the result was a new hypothesis following the wave model of johannes schmidt suggesting that the satem isogloss represents a linguistic innovation in the central part of the proto indo european home range and the centum languages along the eastern and the western peripheries did not undergo that change most scholars reject walter bruno henning s proposed link to gutian a language spoken on the iranian plateau in the nd century BC and known only from personal names tocharian probably died out after when the uyghurs expelled from mongolia by the kyrgyz moved into the tarim basin the theory is supported by the discovery of translations of tocharian texts into uyghur some modern chinese words may ultimately derive from a tocharian or related source e g old chinese mjit \\u871c m\\u00ec honey from proto tocharian \\u1e3f\\u0259t \\u0259 where \\u1e3f is palatalized cf tocharian b mit cognate with english mead names a colophon to a buddhist manuscript in old turkish from AD states that it was translated from sanskrit via a tw\\u03b3ry language in emil sieg and friedrich w k m\\u00fcller guessed that this referred to the newly discovered language of the turpan area sieg and m\\u00fcller reading this name as toxr\\u00ef connected it

ttahv\\u0101ra and sanskrit tukh\\u0101ra and proposed the name tocharian german tocharisch ptolemy s t\\u00f3charoi are often associated by modern scholars with the yuezhi of chinese historical accounts who founded the kushan empire it is now clear that these people actually spoke bactrian an eastern iranian language rather than the language of the tarim manuscripts so the term tocharian is considered a misnomer nevertheless it remains the standard term for the language of the tarim basin manuscripts in walter henning found the term four tw\\u03b3ry used in early th century manuscripts in sogdian middle iranian and uighur he argued that it referred to the region on the northeast edge of the tarim including agni and karakhoja but not kucha he thus inferred that the colophon referred to the agnean language although the term tw\\u03b3ry or toxr\\u00ef appears to be the old turkic name for the tocharians it is not found in tocharian texts the apparent self designation \\u0101r\\u015bi appears in tocharian a texts tocharian b texts use the adjective ku\\u015bi\\u00f1\\u00f1e derived from ku\\u015bi or ku\\u010di a name also known from chinese and turkic documents the historian bernard sergent compounded these names to coin an alternative term ar\\u015bi ku\\u010di for the family recently revised to agni ku\\u010di but this name has not achieved widespread usage writing system tocharian is documented in manuscript fragments mostly from the th century with a few earlier ones that were written on palm leaves wooden tablets and chinese paper preserved by the extremely dry climate of the tarim basin samples of the language have been discovered at sites in kucha and karasahr including many mural inscriptions most of attested tocharian was written in the tocharian alphabet a derivative of the brahmi alphabetic syllabary abugida also referred to as north turkestan brahmi or slanting brahmi however a smaller amount was written in the manichaean script in which manichaean texts were recorded it soon became apparent that a large proportion of the manuscripts were translations of known buddhist works in sanskrit and some of them were even bilingual facilitating decipherment of the new language besides the buddhist and manichaean religious texts there were also monastery correspondence and accounts commercial documents caravan permits medical and magical texts and one love poem in chinese linguist ji xianlin published a translation and analysis of fragments of a tocharian maitreyasamiti nataka discovered in in yanqi tocharian a and b tocharian a and b are significantly different to the point of being mutually unintelligible a common proto tocharian language must precede the attested languages by several centuries probably dating to the late st millennium BC tocharian a is found only in the eastern part of the tocharian speaking area and all extant texts are of a religious nature tocharian b however is found throughout the range and in both religious and secular texts as a result it has been suggested that tocharian a was a liturgical language no longer spoken natively while tocharian b was the spoken language of the entire area on the other hand it is possible that the lack of a secular corpus in tocharian a is simply an accident due to the smaller distribution of the language and the fragmentary preservation of tocharian texts in general the hypothesized relationship of tocharian a and b as liturgical and spoken forms respectively is sometimes compared with the relationship between latin and the modern romance languages or classical chinese and mandarin however in both of these latter cases the liturgical language is the linguistic ancestor of the spoken language whereas no such relationship holds between tocharian a and b in fact from a phonological perspective tocharian b is significantly more conservative than tocharian a and serves as the primary source for reconstructing proto tocharian only tocharian b preserves the following proto tocharian features stress distinctions final vowels diphthongs and o vs e distinction in turn the loss of final vowels in tocharian a has led to the loss of certain proto tocharian categories still found in tocharian b e g the vocative case and some of the noun verb and adjective declensional classes in their declensional and conjugational endings the two languages innovated in divergent ways with neither clearly simpler than the other for example both languages show significant innovations in the present active indicative endings but in radically different ways so that only the second person singular ending is directly cognate between the two languages and in most cases neither variant is directly cognate with the corresponding proto indo european PIE form the agglutinative secondary case endings in the two languages likewise stem from different sources showing parallel development of the secondary case system after the proto tocharian period likewise some of the verb classes show independent origins e g the class II preterite which uses reduplication in tocharian a possibly from the reduplicated aorist but long PIE \\u0113 in tocharian b possibly related to the long vowel perfect found in latin l\\u0113g\\u012b f\\u0113c\\u012b etc tocharian b shows an internal chronological development three linguistic stages have been detected the oldest stage is attested only in kucha there are also the middle classical\\u02bc and the late stage tocharian c based on rd century loulan g\\u0101ndh\\u0101r\\u012b prakrit documents containing tocharian loanwords such as kilme district \\u1e63o\\u1e63tha\\u1e43ga tax collector and \\u1e63ilpoga document t burrow suggested in the s the existence of a third tocharian language which has been labelled tocharian c or kror\\u00e4nian krorainic or lolanisch in ten texts written in the kharo\\u1e63\\u1e6dh\\u012b alphabet from loulan were published and analyzed in the posthumous papers of tocharologist klaus t schmidt as being written in tocharian c schmidt suggested that the language was closer to tocharian b than to tocharian a on september and a group of linguists led by georges pinault and micha\\u00ebl peyrot met in leiden to examine schmidt s transcriptions and the original texts and concluded they had all been transcribed entirely incorrectly their conclusions appear to have discredited schmidt s tocharian c claims phonology phonetically tocharian languages are centum indo european languages meaning that they merge the palatovelar consonants \\u1e31 \\u01f5 \\u01f5\\u02b0 of proto indo european with the plain velars k g g\\u02b0 rather than palatalizing them to affricates or sibilants centum languages are mostly found in western and southern europe greek italic celtic germanic in that sense tocharian to some extent like the greek and the anatolian languages seems to have been an isolate in the satem i e palatovelar to sibilant phonetic regions of indo european speaking populations the discovery of tocharian contributed to doubts that proto indo european had originally split into western and eastern branches today the centum satem division is not seen as a real familial division vowels tocharian a and tocharian b have the same set of vowels but they often do not correspond to each other for example the sound a did not occur in proto tocharian tocharian b a is derived from former stressed \\u00e4 or unstressed \\u0101 reflected unchanged in tocharian a while tocharian a a stems from proto tocharian \\u025b or \\u0254 reflected as e and o in tocharian b and tocharian a e and o stem largely from monophthongization of former diphthongs still present in tocharian b diphthongs diphthongs occur in tocharian b only consonants the following table lists the reconstructed phonemes in tocharian along with their standard transcription because tocharian is written in an alphabet used originally for sanskrit and its descendants the transcription of the sounds is directly based on the transcription of the corresponding sanskrit sounds the tocharian alphabet also has letters representing all of the remaining sanskrit sounds but these appear only in sanskrit loanwords and are not thought to have had distinct pronunciations in tocharian there is some uncertainty as to actual pronunciation of some of the letters particularly those representing palatalized obstruents see below n is transcribed by two different letters in the tocharian alphabet depending on position based on the corresponding letters in sanskrit these are transcribed \\u1e43 word finally including before certain clitics and n elsewhere but \\u1e43 represents n not m the sound written c is thought to correspond to a palatal stop c in sanskrit the tocharian pronunciation t\\u0255 is suggested by the common occurrence of the cluster \\u015bc but the exact pronunciation cannot be determined with certainty the sound written \\u1e63 corresponds to retroflex sibilant \\u0282 in sanskrit but it seems more likely to have been a palato alveolar sibilant \\u0283 as in english ship because it derives from a palatalized s the sound \\u1e45 \\u014b occurs only before k or in some clusters where a k has been deleted between consonants it is clearly phonemic because sequences nk and \\u00f1k also exist from syncope of a former \\u00e4 between them morphology nouns tocharian has completely re worked the nominal declension system of proto indo european the only cases inherited from the proto language are nominative genitive accusative and in tocharian b only vocative in tocharian the old accusative is known as the oblique case in addition to these primary cases however each tocharian language has six cases formed by the addition of an invariant suffix to the oblique case although the set of six cases is not the same in each language and the suffixes are largely non cognate for example the tocharian word yakwe toch b yuk toch a horse PIE e\\u1e31wos is declined as follows the tocharian a instrumental case rarely occurs with humans when referring to humans the oblique singular of most adjectives and of some nouns is marked in both varieties by an ending a \\u1e43 which also appears in the secondary cases an example is e\\u1e45kwe toch b o\\u1e45k toch a man which belongs to the same declension as above but has oblique singular e\\u1e45kwe\\u1e43 toch b o\\u1e45ka\\u1e43 toch a and corresponding oblique stems e\\u1e45kwe\\u1e43 toch b o\\u1e45kn toch a for the secondary cases this is thought to stem from the generalization of n stem adjectives as an indication of determinative semantics seen most prominently in the weak adjective declension in the germanic languages where it cooccurs with definite articles and determiners but also in latin and greek n stem nouns especially proper names formed from adjectives e g latin cat\\u014d genitive cat\\u014dnis literally the sly one catus sly greek pl\\u00e1t\\u014dn literally the broad shouldered one plat\\u00fas broad verbs in contrast the verb verbal conjugation system is quite conservative the majority of proto indo european verbal classes and categories are represented in some manner in tocharian although not necessarily with the same function some examples athematic and thematic present tenses including null y s\\u1e31 s n and nh suffixes as well as n infixes and various laryngeal ending stems o grade and possibly lengthened grade perfects although lacking reduplication or augment sigmatic reduplicated thematic and possibly lengthened grade aorists optatives imperatives and possibly PIE subjunctives in addition most PIE sets of endings are found in some form in tocharian although with significant innovations including thematic and athematic endings primary non past and secondary past endings active and mediopassive endings and perfect endings dual endings are still found although they are rarely attested and generally restricted to the third person the mediopassive still reflects the distinction between primary r and secondary i effaced in most indo european languages both root and suffix ablaut is still well represented although again with significant innovations categories tocharian verbs are conjugated in the following categories mood indicative subjunctive optative imperative tense aspect in the indicative only present preterite imperfect voice active mediopassive deponent person st nd rd number singular dual plural causation basic causative non finite active participle mediopassive participle present gerundive subjunctive gerundive classes a given verb belongs to one of a large number of classes according to its conjugation as in sanskrit ancient greek and to a lesser extent latin there are independent sets of classes in the indicative present subjunctive perfect imperative and to a limited extent optative and imperfect and there is no general correspondence among the different sets of classes meaning that each verb must be specified using a number of principal parts present indicative the most complex system is the present indicative consisting of classes thematic and athematic with distinct sets of thematic and athematic endings the following classes occur in tocharian b some are missing in tocharian a i athematic without suffix PIE root athematic II thematic without suffix PIE root thematic III thematic with ptoch suffix \\u00eb mediopassive only apparently reflecting consistent PIE o theme rather than the normal alternating o e theme IV thematic with ptoch suffix \\u0254 mediopassive only same PIE origin as previous class but diverging within proto tocharian v athematic with ptoch suffix \\u0101 likely from either PIE verbs ending in a syllabic laryngeal or PIE derived verbs in eh\\u2082 but extended to other verbs VI athematic with ptoch suffix n\\u0101 from PIE verbs in nh VII athematic with infixed nasal from PIE infixed nasal verbs VIII thematic with suffix s possibly from PIE s\\u1e31 IX thematic with suffix sk PIE s\\u1e31 x thematic with ptoch suffix n\\u00e4sk n\\u0101sk evidently a combination of classes VI and IX XI thematic in ptoch suffix s\\u00e4sk evidently a combination of classes VIII and IX XII thematic with ptoch suffix \\u00e4 \\u00f1\\u00f1 either PIE n y denominative to n stem nouns or PIE nh y deverbative from PIE nh verbs palatalization of the final root consonant occurs in the nd singular rd singular rd dual and nd plural in thematic classes II and VIII XII as a result of the original PIE thematic vowel e subjunctive the subjunctive likewise has classes denoted i through xii most are conjugated identically to the corresponding indicative classes indicative and subjunctive are distinguished by the fact that a verb in a given indicative class will usually belong to a different subjunctive class in addition four subjunctive classes differ from the corresponding indicative classes two special subjunctive classes with differing suffixes and two varying subjunctive classes with root ablaut reflecting the PIE perfect special subjunctives iv thematic with suffix i PIE y with consistent palatalization of final root consonant tocharian b only rare vii thematic not athematic as in indicative class VII with suffix \\u00f1 PIE n palatalized by thematic e with palatalized variant generalized varying subjunctives i athematic without suffix with root ablaut reflecting PIE o grade in active singular zero grade elsewhere derived from PIE perfect v identical to class i but with ptoch suffix \\u0101 originally reflecting laryngeal final roots but generalized preterite the preterite has classes i the most common class with a suffix \\u0101 PIE \\u1e25 i e roots ending in a laryngeal although widely extended to other roots this class shows root ablaut with original e grade and palatalization of the initial root consonant in the active singular contrasting with zero grade and no palatalization elsewhere II this class has reduplication in tocharian a possibly reflecting the PIE reduplicated aorist however tocharian b has a vowel reflecting long PIE \\u0113 along with palatalization of the initial root consonant there is no ablaut in this class III this class has a suffix s in the rd singular active and throughout the mediopassive evidently reflecting the PIE sigmatic aorist root ablaut occurs between active and mediopassive a few verbs have palatalization in the active along with s in the rd singular but no palatalization and no s in the mediopassive along with no root ablaut the vowel reflects ptoch \\u00eb this suggests that for these verbs in particular the active originates in the PIE sigmatic aorist with s suffix and \\u0113 vocalism while the mediopassive stems from the PIE perfect with o vocalism IV this class has suffix \\u1e63\\u1e63\\u0101 with no ablaut most verbs in this class are causatives v this class has suffix \\u00f1 \\u00f1 \\u0101 with no ablaut only a few verbs belong to this class VI this class which has only two verbs is derived from the PIE thematic aorist as in greek this class has different endings from all the others which partly reflect the PIE secondary endings as expected for the thematic aorist all except preterite class VI have a common set of endings that stem from the PIE perfect endings although with significant innovations imperative the imperative likewise shows classes with a unique set of endings found only in the second person and a prefix beginning with p this prefix usually reflects proto tocharian p\\u00e4 but unexpected connecting vowels occasionally occur and the prefix combines with vowel initial and glide initial roots in unexpected ways the prefix is often compared with the slavic perfective prefix po although the phonology is difficult to explain classes i through v tend to co occur with preterite classes i through v although there are many exceptions class vi is not so much a coherent class as an irregular class with all verbs not fitting in other categories the imperative classes tend to share the same suffix as the corresponding preterite if any but to have root vocalism that matches the vocalism of a verb s subjunctive this includes the root ablaut of subjunctive classes i and v which tend to co occur with imperative class i optative and imperfect the optative and imperfect have related formations the optative is generally built by adding i onto the subjunctive stem tocharian b likewise forms the imperfect by adding i onto the present indicative stem while tocharian a has separate imperfect formations usually \\u0101 is added to the subjunctive stem but occasionally to the indicative stem and sometimes either \\u0101 or s is added directly onto the root the endings differ between the two languages tocharian a uses present endings for the optative and preterite endings for the imperfect while tocharian b uses the same endings for both which are a combination of preterite and unique endings the latter used in the singular active endings as suggested by the above discussion there are a large number of sets of endings the present tense endings come in both thematic and athematic variants although they are related with the thematic endings generally reflecting a theme vowel PIE e or o plus the athematic endings there are different sets for the preterite classes i through v preterite class VI the imperative and in tocharian b in the singular active of the optative and imperfect furthermore each set of endings comes with both active and mediopassive forms the mediopassive forms are quite conservative directly reflecting the PIE variation between r in the present and i in the past most other languages with the mediopassive have generalized one of the two the present tense endings are almost completely divergent between tocharian a and b the following shows the thematic endings with their origin comparison to other indo european languages in traditional indo european studies no hypothesis of a closer genealogical relationship of the tocharian languages has been widely accepted by linguists however lexicostatistical and glottochronological approaches suggest the anatolian languages including hittite might be the closest relatives of tocharian as an example the same proto indo european root h\\u2082wrg h but not a common suffixed formation can be reconstructed to underlie the words for wheel tocharian a w\\u00e4rk\\u00e4nt tokharian b yerkwanto and hittite \\u1e2b\\u016brkis notable example most of the texts known from the

        "### Cosine Similarity Between Documents\n",
        "We previously learned how the Euclidean distance between two feature vectors could be used as a measure of similarity between the two corresponding documents from which those vectors were derived. There are, however, many other measures that can be used to judge how similar two documents are to each other. One of the most widely used measures of similarity among text mining practitioners is ***cosine similarity***.\n",

If we think of our document vectors in this way, then we can \"plot\" the documents in our corpus as lines in a geometric space. This concept is illustrated for three documents (*A*, *B*, and *C*) in the figure below:\n",

The ***cosine similarity*** between two documents, then, is simply the cosine of the angle between the two corresponding document vectors. This is a very convenient measure of similarity because `cos(π/2) = 0` while `cos(0) = 1`. Cosine similary values thus naturally range from 0.0 to 1.0, with a value of 0.0 meaning completely dissimilar and a value of 1.0 meaning completely identical. Neat!"

To access the actual cosine similarity value, we thus need to specify the value's row an column indexes. In this example, the value that we want is located at row 0, column 0 within the matrix, which is why we're using `[0][0]` in the code cell below.\n",

            "article 0: instrumental magnitude refers to an uncalibrated apparent magnitude and like its counterpart it refers to the brightness of an astronomical object seen from an observer on earth but unlike its counterpart it is only useful in relative comparisons to other astronomical objects in the same image assuming the photometric calibration does not spatially vary across the image in the case of images from the palomar transient factory the absolute photometric calibration involves a zero point that varies over the image by up to magnitudes to make a required illumination correction instrumental magnitude is defined in various ways and so when working with instrumental magnitudes it is important to know how they are defined the most basic definition of instrumental magnitude m displaystyle m is given by m log f displaystyle m log f where f displaystyle f is the intensity of the source object in known physical units for example in the paper by mighell it was assumed that the data are in units of electron number generated within pixels of a charge coupled device the physical units of the source intensity are thus part of the definition required for any instrumental magnitudes that are employed the factor of in the above formula originates from the established fact that the human eye can only clearly distinguish the brightness of two objects if one is at least approximately times brighter than the other the instrumental magnitude is defined such that two objects with a brightness ratio of exactly will differ by precisely magnitudes and this is based on pogson s system of defining each successive magnitude as being fainter by displaystyle we can now relate this to the base logarithmic function and the leading coefficient in the above formula displaystyle cdots the approximate value of is used as a convenience its negative sign assures that brighter objects will have smaller and possibly negative values and tabulated values of base logarithms were available more than three centuries before the advent of computers and calculators references\n",
            "article 108: this glossary of astronomy is a list of definitions of terms and concepts relevant to astronomy and cosmology their sub disciplines and related fields astronomy is concerned with the study of celestial objects and phenomena that originate outside the atmosphere of earth the field of astronomy features an extensive vocabulary and a significant amount of jargon a a type star absolute magnitude a measure of a star s absolute brightness it is defined as the apparent magnitude the star would show if it were located at a distance of parsecs or light years accretion disk a roughly circular mass of diffuse material in orbit around a central object such as a star or black hole the material is acquired from a source external to the central object and friction causes it to spiral inward towards the object active galactic nucleus AGN a compact region in the center of a galaxy displaying a much higher than normal luminosity over some part of the electromagnetic spectrum with characteristics indicating that the luminosity is not produced by stars a galaxy hosting an AGN is called an active galaxy albedo a measure of the proportion of the total solar radiation received by an astronomical body such as a planet that is diffusely reflected away from the body it is a dimensionless quantity typically measured on a scale from indicating total absorption of all incident radiation as by a black body to indicating total reflection the albedo reported for an astronomical body may vary widely by the spectral and angular distribution of the incident radiation by the layer of the body being measured e g upper atmosphere versus surface and by local variation within these layers e g cloud cover and geological or environmental surface features albedo feature a large area on the surface of a reflecting object that shows a significant contrast in brightness or darkness albedo compared to adjacent areas am star a chemically peculiar star belonging to the more general class of a type stars the spectrum of the am stars shows abnormal enhancements and deficiencies of certain metals see metallicity aphelion the point at which a body orbiting the earth s sun is furthest from the sun contrast perihelion apoapsis the point at which an orbiting body is furthest from its primary contrast periapsis apogee the point at which a body orbiting the earth such as the moon or an artificial satellite is furthest from the earth contrast perigee apparent magnitude also called visual brightness v a measure of the brightness of a celestial body as seen by an observer on earth adjusted to the value it would have in the absence of the atmosphere the brighter the object appears the lower its magnitude appulse the closest approach of one celestial object to another as viewed from a third body apsis in the orbit of a planetary body one of the two extreme points of distance between the body and its primary either the point of minimal distance called the periapsis or the point of maximal distance called the apoapsis the term may also be used to refer to the value of the distance rather than the point itself all elliptical orbits have exactly two apsides argument of periapsis also called the argument of perifocus or argument of pericenter the angle from an orbiting body s ascending node to its periapsis measured in the direction of motion it is one of six canonical orbital elements used to characterize an orbit artificial satellite an object that has been intentionally placed into orbit by humans often around the earth but also around other bodies within the solar system contrast natural satellite ascending node also called the north node the orbital node at which an orbiting object moves north through the plane of reference in geocentric and heliocentric orbits or at which the orbiting object moves away from the observer in orbits outside of the solar system the position of the ascending node with respect to a reference direction called the longitude of the ascending node is used along with other parameters to describe an orbit contrast descending node asterism any pattern of stars recognizable in earth s night sky an asterism may form part of an official constellation or it may be composed of stars from more than one constellation asteroid asteroid belt the circumstellar disc in the solar system located roughly between the orbits of mars and jupiter that is occupied by numerous irregularly shaped small solar system bodies ranging in size from dust particles to asteroids and minor planets the asteroid belt is often called the main asteroid belt or main belt to distinguish it from other asteroid populations in other parts of the solar system astrobiology astrodynamics see orbital mechanics astrogeology astrometric binary a type of binary system where evidence for an unseen orbiting companion is revealed by its periodic gravitational perturbation of the visible component see also spectroscopic binary astrometry the branch of astronomy that involves precise measurements of the positions and movements of stars and other celestial bodies astronomical body also called a celestial body a type of naturally occurring physical entity association or structure within the observable universe that is a single tightly bound contiguous structure such as a star planet moon or asteroid though the terms astronomical body and astronomical object are often used interchangeably there are technical distinctions astronomical catalogue also spelled astronomical catalog astronomical object also called a celestial object a type of naturally occurring physical entity association or structure that exists within the observable universe but is a more complex less cohesively bound structure than an astronomical body consisting perhaps of multiple bodies or even other objects with substructures such as a planetary system star cluster nebula or galaxy though the terms astronomical object and astronomical body are often used interchangeably there are technical distinctions astronomical symbol astronomical unit AU a unit of length used primarily for measuring astronomical distances within the solar system or between the earth and distant stars originally conceived as the approximate average distance between the centers of the earth and the sun the astronomical unit is now more rigidly defined as exactly kilometres miles parsecs light years astronomy the scientific study of celestial objects and phenomena the origins of those objects and phenomena and their evolution astrophotography astrophysics the branch of astronomy that employs principles of physics and chemistry to determine the nature of astronomical objects and phenomena examining properties such as luminosity density temperature and chemical composition rather than the positions or motions of objects in space which is more specifically the emphasis of celestial mechanics atmosphere axial precession a slow continuous gravity induced change a precession in the orientation of an astronomical body s axis of rotation the term often refers in particular to the gradual shift in the orientation of earth s rotational axis with respect to its orbital plane over a cycle of approximately years which is caused predominantly by the gravitational influence of the moon and the sun on the earth s equatorial bulge the phenomenon is similar to but much larger in magnitude than other changes in the alignment of earth s axis such as nutation and polar motion and is the cause of the apparent precession of the equinoxes in the night sky axial tilt also called obliquity the angle between an object s rotational axis and its orbital axis or equivalently the angle between its equatorial plane and orbital plane axial tilt usually does not change considerably during a single orbital period earth s axial tilt is the cause of the seasons axial tilt is distinct from orbital inclination axis of rotation azimuth an angular measurement of an object s orientation along the horizon of the observer relative to the direction of true north when combined with the altitude above the horizon it defines an object s current position in the spherical coordinate system b barycenter the common center of mass about which any two or more bodies of a gravitationally bound system orbit the barycenter is one of the foci of the elliptical orbit of each body participating in the system its location is strongly influenced by the mass of each body and the distances between them for example in a planetary system where the mass of the central star is significantly larger than the mass of an orbiting planet the barycenter may actually be located within the radius of the star such that the planet appears to orbit the star itself though both bodies actually orbit the shared barycenter baryogenesis the process by which the class of subatomic particles known as baryons were generated in the early universe including the means by which baryons outnumber antibaryons big bang the prevailing cosmological model for the origin of the observable universe it depicts a starting condition of extremely high density and temperature followed by an ongoing expansion that led to the current conditions binary star a star system consisting of exactly two stars orbiting around their common barycenter the term is often used interchangeably with double star though the latter can also refer to an optical double star a type of optical illusion which is entirely distinct from true binary star systems black hole a concentration of mass so compact that it creates a region of space from which not even light can escape the outer boundary of this region is called the event horizon

to and very inactive below circumstellar disc also spelled circumstellar disk cis neptunian object CNO clearing the neighbourhood color index a numeric value that is used to compare the brightness of a star measured from different frequency bands of the electromagnetic spectrum because the energy output of a star varies by frequency as a function of temperature the color index can be used to

a visible coma around the cometary body sometimes a comet can produce a long tail radiating away from the sun commensurability a property of two objects orbiting the same body whose orbital periods are in a rational proportion for example the orbital period of saturn around the sun is very nearly the orbital period of jupiter common proper motion a term used to indicate that two or more stars share the same motion through space within the margin of observational error that is either they have nearly the same proper motion and radial velocity parameters which may suggest that they are gravitationally bound or share a common origin or they are known to be gravitationally bound in which case their proper motions may be rather different but average to be the same over time compact star also called a compact object any astronomical body with a very high mass relative to its radius compared to most ordinary atomic matter typically very high density objects such as white dwarfs neutron stars and black holes or to stellar remnants with very small radii compared to ordinary stars compact stellar nucleus see nuclear star cluster conjunction a phenomenon during which two

near each other on the celestial sphere either because the two stars coincidentally lie along nearly the same line of sight from the earth despite being physically distant from each other or because the two stars are actually located in physical proximity to each other by which they may form a co moving pair or a binary star system dwarf planet dwarf star the category of ordinary main sequence stars like the sun in contrast to evolved giant stars like betelgeuse and antares confusingly the term has also come to include stellar remnants known as white dwarfs as well as low mass substellar objects known as brown dwarfs e early type star a hotter and more massive star in contrast to late type stars that are cooler and less massive the term originated from historical stellar models that assumed stars began their early life at a high temperature then gradually cooled off as they aged it may be used to refer to the higher temperature members of any particular population or category of stars rather than of all stars in general eccentricity see orbital eccentricity ecliptic coordinate system ecliptic plane also called the plane of the ecliptic or simply the ecliptic the plane defined by the earth s orbit around the sun hence the position of the sun as viewed from the earth defines the intersection of this plane with the celestial sphere the ecliptic is widely used as a reference

be used to build isochrones by putting curves through equal age points along the tracks when the mass of a star can be determined an isochrone can be used to estimate the star s age j jeans instability a physical state in which an interstellar cloud of gas will begin to undergo collapse and form stars a cloud can become unstable against collapse when it cools sufficiently or has perturbations of density allowing gravity to overcome the gas pressure julian year a a unit of time defined as exactly days of SI seconds each because these are units of constant duration the julian year is also constant and does not vary with a specific calendar or with any of the other means of determining the length of a year such as the tropical year it is therefore widely used as the basis

to several dwarf planets including pluto l lagrangian point also called a lagrange point libration point or l point any of a set of points near two large bodies in orbit at which a smaller object will maintain a constant position relative to the larger bodies at other locations a small object would eventually be pulled into its own orbit around one of the large bodies but at the lagrangian points the gravitational forces of the large bodies the centripetal force of orbital motion and in certain scenarios the coriolis acceleration all align in a way that causes the small object to become locked in a stable or nearly stable relative position for each combination of two orbital bodies there are five such lagrangian points typically identified with the labels l to l the phenomenon is the basis for the stable orbits of trojan satellites and is commonly exploited by man made satellites laniakea supercluster also called the lenakaeia supercluster local supercluster or local SCI late type star

of the lunar disk light year ly a unit of length used to express astronomical distances that is equivalent to the distance that an object moving at the speed of light in a vacuum would travel in one julian year approximately trillion kilometres x km or trillion miles x mi though the light year is often used to measure galactic scale distances in non specialist publications the unit of length most commonly used in professional astrometry is the parsec limb darkening an optical effect seen in stars including the sun where the center part of the disk appears brighter than the edge or limb of the image line of apsides the imaginary line connecting the two apsides the periapsis and the apoapsis of an elliptical orbit and which therefore represents the distance of the orbit s longest axis local

these stars are characterized by being in hydrostatic equilibrium and undergoing nuclear fusion of hydrogen in their core region the sun is a main sequence star march equinox also called the northward equinox the precise time of year on earth when the sun appears to cross the celestial equator while generally trending northward at each zenith passage it represents the moment at which the north pole of the earth begins to tilt toward the sun and typically occurs on or near march each year it is the vernal equinox in the northern hemisphere and the autumnal equinox in the southern hemisphere contrast september equinox mean anomaly m the fraction of an elliptical orbit s period that has elapsed since the orbiting body passed periapsis expressed as the angular distance from the pericenter which a fictitious body would have if it moved in a perfectly circular orbit in the same orbital period as the actual body in its elliptical orbit the mean anomaly does not correspond to a real geometric angle as does the true anomaly but is a contrived parameter used to make calculating the position of the orbiting body in the two body problem mathematically convenient meridian a line

comet hunter charles messier between and meteor also called a shooting star or falling star the visible passage of a glowing meteoroid micrometeoroid comet or asteroid through the earth s atmosphere usually as a long streak of light produced when such an object is heated to incandescence by collisions with air molecules in the upper atmosphere leaving an ionization trail as a result of its rapid motion and sometimes also the shedding of material in its wake meteorite a solid piece of debris from a meteor that originated in outer space and survived its passage through the atmosphere to reach the surface of a planet or moon meteoroid a small rock or boulder that has entered a planetary atmosphere if it survives to reach the surface it is then termed a meteorite meteor shower a series of meteors that seemingly radiate from a single area in the night sky these are produced by debris left over from a larger body such as a comet and hence they follow roughly the same orbit this makes many meteor showers predictable events as they recur every year metallicity a measure of the abundance of elements other than hydrogen and helium within an astronomical object note that this definition includes elements that are not traditionally considered metallic by chemical convention micrometeorite a very small meteorite that has survived its passage through the atmosphere to reach the surface of a planet or moon usually ranging in size from µm to mm micrometeorites are a major component of cosmic dust micrometeoroid a very small meteoroid usually weighing less than one gram if

natural satellite moon the solid rocky body that orbits the earth as its only natural satellite completing a full orbit every days the moon s gravitational influence is responsible for tides on earth because of tidal locking only one side of the moon is ever visible from the earth sunlight reflected from its surface makes the moon appear very bright in the night sky though its orbital position with respect to the earth and the sun causes its visibility to change in a regular cycle of phases when viewed from the earth the adjectival lunar is often used to specifically describe the orbit

        "## Document Clustering\n",
        "We will now turn our attention to document clustering, the goal of which is to automatically identify similarities and dissimilarities among the documents in a corpus, and then classify documents into groups based on how similar they are. These clustering methods are **unsupervised**, meaning that the algorithms assign documents to clusters automatically based on similarity without us telling them if their choices are correct or not. It is very important to remember that ***similarity*** can mean many different things. In our case, similarity is based on TF-IDF scores, which encode information about the *textual content* of a document. If we had used a different similarity metric (e.g., sentiment, document length, politcal bias, writing style, etc.), the clustering algorithms would attempt to classify the documents into groups based on how similar they are along those dimensions.\n",

        "There are two major types of clustering algorithms:\n",

        "\n",
        "###Agglomerative Hierarchical Clustering\n",
        "In this type of clustering, similar objects are gradually grouped into larger and larger clusters, beginning with individual documents and progressing to groups of documents. A useful way of visualizing hierarchical clusters is through the use of a **dendrogram**, which is a type of diagram that depicts a tree structure.\n",

        "The dendrogram suggests that there are likely three major clusters of articles in the corpus. How do we know? Well, a heuristic method of identifying the optimal number of clusters is to find the maximum vertical height of a rectangle that is overlayed across the entire dendrogram, with the constraint that the rectangle cannot \"touch\" any of the horizontal lines on the dendrogram. This rectangle is shown in light red in the image below. The optimal number of clusters, then, is the number of vertical lines that pass through the rectangle. In this case, three vertical lines pass through the rectangle (numbered *1.*, *2.*, and *3.*), suggesting that the optimal number of clusters is three.\n",

metropolitan area in the US state of washington it is in the city of seatac approximately miles km south of downtown seattle and miles km north northeast of downtown tacoma the airport the largest in the pacific northwest region of north america is situated between portland oregon and vancouver british columbia and owned by the port of seattle the entire airport covers an area of acres or square miles km much more dense than other US airports with similar annual passenger numbers the airport has flights to cities throughout north america europe the middle east asia and oceania it is the primary hub for alaska airlines whose headquarters are near the airport it is also a hub and international gateway to asia for delta air lines which has expanded at the airport since thirty four airlines serve non stop domestic and international destinations history the airport was built by the port of seattle in after the US military took control of boeing field in world war II the port received million from the civil aeronautics administration to build the airport and from the city of tacoma the first scheduled airline flights were northwest and trans canada in western and united moved from boeing field in the next couple of years and pan am moved in but west coast and successors air west and hughes airwest stayed at boeing field until the original terminal was designed by architect herman a moldenhour the official opening ceremony took place on july in front of a crowd of in june four runways were at degree angles between and feet and m long the northeast southwest and northwest southeast runways intersected just west of the north south runway that eventually became today s runway r runway was lengthened to ft in to ft by and to ft by the extension required the construction of an automobile tunnel for south th street which opened in july runway l replaced runway around the april OAG shows departures a week on united northwest western trans canada pan am pacific northern and alaska the first jet flights were pan am boeing s to honolulu via portland OR in late pan am s timetable for september shows a weekly jet in scandinavian airlines began the airport s first non stop flight to mainland europe pan am nonstops to london began around the first concourse opened in july the two story north concourse later dubbed concourse d added four gate positions and a new wing feet m long and feet m wide the one story south concourse now concourse a opened in adding another feet m to the length of the airport the foot m long concourse b opened in december it added eight gate positions bringing the total to a square feet m area housing international arrivals and the offices of US customs immigration public health and the department of agriculture concourse c opened in july just four years later it was extended to include another gates bringing the total to the port embarked on a major expansion plan designed by the richardson associates and lasting from to adding a second runway a parking garage two satellite terminals and other improvements in million new terminal was built over and around the structure the new terminal quadrupled the area for public use on july the airport opened two new satellite terminals along with an underground train system to connect them to the main terminal in the mid s the main terminal was renovated and another feet m was added to the north end concourse d was expanded in with a rotunda that added four new gates in concourses b c and d were renovated the project designed by NBBJ included the addition of square feet m and the renovation of square feet m of space in concourses b c and d on june the foot m new concourse a was unveiled with new gates a dozen new restaurants new artwork and the airport s first moving sidewalks residents of the surrounding area filed lawsuits against the port in the early s complaining of noise vibration smoke and other problems the port and the government of king county adopted the sea tac communities plan in to address problems and guide future development the port spent more than million over the next decade to buy homes and school buildings in the vicinity and soundproof others nearby in the mid s the airport participated in the airport noise compatibility program initiated by congress in airport noise contours were developed real estate was purchased and some homes were retrofitted to achieve noise mitigation in the US ended airline regulation and US airlines were allowed to determine routes and fares without government approval deregulation resulted in new service to seattle including from TWA then the fourth largest US airline as well as delta national and american after the death of US senator henry martin scoop jackson in the seattle port commission voted to change the airport s name to the henry m jackson international airport citizens of tacoma interpreted the change as an insult to their community the second time in the airport s history that the port authorities had attempted to remove tacoma from the name the tacoma had provided for the airport s construction during world war II had come with an explicit promise that the city would be included in the airport s name an additional complicating factor was the existence of another jackson international airport now jackson medgar wiley evers international airport in jackson mississippi whose management threatened legal action to preserve its exclusive use of the name the controversy was resolved after polls of seattle and tacoma area residents showed their preference for the original name by margins as much as helen jackson the widow of the late senator henry m jackson expressed her desire that their family remain neutral in the debate with a vote of the port of seattle commission the name reverted to sea tac in early in the late s the port of seattle and a council representing local county governments considered the future of air traffic in the region and predicted that the airport could reach capacity by in the planning committee concluded that the best solution was to add a third runway to the airport and construct a supplemental two runway airport in one of the neighboring counties members of the community opposed a third runway as did the highline school district and the cities of des moines burien federal way tukwila and normandy park but a study concluded there were no feasible sites for an additional airport the port of seattle approved a plan for the new runway in prompting a lawsuit from opponents the port secured the necessary permits by agreeing to noise reduction programs and environmental protections runway opponents appealed these permits but dropped their challenges in recent years the airport s central terminal building was renovated and expanded in in a project designed by curtis w fentress of fentress architects the third runway opened on november with a construction cost of billion parallel to the existing two the new runway is ft west of runway r allowing landings on both in times of low visibility the older runways are ft apart too close to allow use of both in low visibility in delta air lines announced plans to expand seattle into a transpacific hub since then delta has added numerous international flights and dozens of domestic flights to feed those services delta s increased presence in seattle has been seen by some industry analysts as a response to united airlines transpacific hub at san francisco as well as delta s disenchantment with its former tokyo narita hub delta s expansion at seattle tacoma has created some controversy many of the new domestic services delta started offering from seattle to boost traffic to international flights encroached on routes that alaska airlines previously a long time partner of delta has historically operated delta is seeking a total of gates nearly triple its current gates to accommodate its planned growth future sea tac airport has seen record growth in passenger traffic over the last few years that growth has been partly fueled by the nationwide expansion of seattle based alaska airlines and by delta air lines setting up a major international hub at sea tac airport that growth has strained the airport s facilities and led the port to invest more than billion into several expansion and renovation projects sea tac airport has six outbound baggage handling systems with limited to no cross connectivity the system now in place is aging and reaching its maximum capacity this million project will create one unified high speed baggage system under the airport that will allow bags to be checked from any ticketing counter to receive security screening faster and to be routed to any gate in the airport the extra efficiency and speed will allow the airport to handle more baggage in the future without expanding the footprint of the baggage handling systems the initial phase of the project was finished in and the entire system will be in place by the north satellite terminal has only received limited upgrades since it was opened in and is in need of modernization the port of seattle initially looked at simply updating the terminal in a project it called the north satellite renovation plan northstar in it was announced the port would also significantly expand the terminal the million project now called the north satellite modernization will increase the size of the north satellite by square feet and another eight gates bringing the total to the project s first phase dedicated on july expanded the terminal to the west by feet m and added eight gates a mezzanine level with eateries and a rooftop lounge for alaska airlines the second phase scheduled to be complete by will modernize the remaining areas of the old terminal and expand dining and retail space around the twenty existing gates the international arrivals facility IAF is in the basement of the south satellite it is known to have become severely overcrowded at peak arrival times additionally the process for passengers is complicated by the terminal s isolated location to address the situation the port of seattle is building a new square foot IAF east of concourse a in the main terminal building the facility will increase capacity by nearly percent by increasing the number of passport check booths and kiosks from to and the number of baggage claim carousels from four to seven the new IAF will be connected to the south satellite by a foot long bridge aerial walkway that will take passengers feet above the existing airplane taxiway and over the top of concourse a the project was initially expected to be completed by at a cost of million in late the cost was re calculated to million after the new IAF opens the south satellite will continue to be used for arriving international flights additional international gates will be added in concourse a nearly doubling the number of gates capable of serving larger wide body aircraft once the new international arrivals facility is complete the port of seattle will renovate the south satellite terminal with estimates that the puget sound region will grow by another one million people by the port of seattle began developing the sustainable airport master plan SAMP in to meet passenger and cargo demands the SAMP recommends more than projects to improve efficiency and airport access including a new terminal with gates and an automated people mover through three separate stations according to alaska airlines the airport s largest carrier the facility s plan for a gate terminal would transform sea tac into one of the most congested hubs in the united states as a result of the new terminal being disconnected from the existing terminal passengers moving between terminals would be required travel to reach the other terminal as well as go through separate security screenings in each terminal according to the port s timeline the final national environmental policy act and washington state policy act analyses will be completed by winter facilities terminal seattle tacoma has gates on four concourses and two satellite buildings the two satellite terminal buildings named the north and south satellite are connected to the four concourses in the main terminal by a three line automated people mover system called the satellite transit system the underground system moves passengers quickly within the four concourses of the central terminal and out to the two satellite terminals all non precleared international arrivals are currently handled at the south satellite terminal regardless of their departure terminal concourse a contains gates concourse b contains gates concourse c contains gates concourse d contains gates north satellite contains gates south satellite contains gates airfield the three parallel runways run nearly north south west of the passenger terminal and are to feet m

the FAA issued an alert notice dated from august to september urging airplanes about taking precautions such as reils and other visual cues while landing from the north in the airport became the first airport to implement an avian radar system providing hour monitoring of wildlife activity across the airfield this pilot program designed and implemented with the assistance of the university of illinois center of excellence for airport technology CEAT was designed to decrease potentially fatal incidents involving collisions with birds and to provide a test bed for implementation of the technology in the US which was expected to begin in the technology is part of a strategy to reduce the presence of wildlife on the airfield the seattle office of the national weather service operates a weather station at the airport with a temperature gauge between the center and eastern runways the airport has served as seattle s official weather recording location since ground transportation the site of sea tac was chosen partly due to its location along state route approximately midway between seattle and tacoma interstate and interstate also converge near the airport with an easy connection to the airport via state route and the airport expressway state route runs to the west of the airport connecting the area to west seattle the airport is the largest generator of vehicle trips in the

            "cluster 0: the space needle is an observation tower in seattle washington united states considered to be an icon of the city and the pacific northwest it has been designated a seattle landmark located in the lower queen anne neighborhood it was built in the seattle center for the world s fair which drew over million visitors nearly people a day used its elevators during the event the space needle was once the tallest structure west of the mississippi river standing at ft m the tower is ft m wide weighs short tons metric tons and is built to withstand winds of up to mph km h and earthquakes of up to magnitude as strong as the cascadia earthquake it also has lightning rods the space needle features an observation deck ft m above ground providing views of the downtown seattle skyline the olympic and cascade mountains mount rainier mount baker elliott bay and various islands in puget sound visitors can reach the top of the space needle by elevators that travel at mph km h completing the ascent in seconds they are slowed to mph km h on windy days on april the city s landmarks preservation board designated the tower a historic landmark architecture the architecture of the space needle is the result of a compromise between the designs of two men edward e carlson and john graham jr the two leading ideas for the world fair involved businessman edward e carlson s sketch of a giant balloon tethered to the ground the gently sloping base and architect john graham s concept of a flying saucer the halo that houses the restaurant and observation deck victor steinbrueck introduced the hourglass profile of the tower the space needle was built to withstand wind speeds of mph km h double the requirements in the building code of the mw nisqually earthquake jolted the needle enough in for water to slosh out of the toilets in the restrooms the space needle will not sustain serious structural damage during earthquakes of magnitudes below also made to withstand category hurricane force winds the space needle sways only in mm per mph km h of wind speed for decades the hovering disk of the space needle was home to two restaurants ft m above the ground the space needle restaurant which was originally named eye of the needle and emerald suite these were closed in to make way for skycity a larger restaurant that features pacific northwest cuisine skycity rotates degrees in exactly forty seven minutes in the elevators were replaced with new computerized versions the new elevators descend at a rate of mph km h on december a powerful beam of light was unveiled for the first time called the legacy light or skybeam it is powered by lamps that total million candela shining skyward from the top of the space needle to honor national holidays and special occasions in seattle the concept of this beam was derived from the official world s fair poster which depicted such a light source although none was incorporated into the original design it is somewhat controversial because of the light pollution it creates originally planned to be turned on nights per year it has generally been used fewer than a dozen times per year it did remain lit for eleven days in a row from september to september in response to the september attacks a seattle world s fair poster showed a grand spiral entryway leading to the elevator that was ultimately omitted from final building plans the stairway was eventually added as part of the pavilion and spacebase remodel in june the main stairwell has steps from the basement to the top of the observation deck at approximately ft m the space needle was the tallest building west of the mississippi river at the time it was built by howard s wright construction co but is now dwarfed by other structures along the seattle skyline among them the columbia center at ft m unlike many other similar structures such as the CN tower in toronto the space needle is not used for broadcasting purposes history construction edward f carlson chairman of the world s fair in seattle had an idea for erecting a tower with a restaurant at the world s fair carlson was president of a hotel company and was not recognized in art or design but he was inspired by a recent visit to the stuttgart tower of germany local architect john graham soon became involved as a result of his success in designing northgate mall graham s first move was to alter the restaurant s original design to a revolving restaurant similar to his previous design of the la ronde tower restaurant at the ala moana shopping center in hawaii the proposed space needle had no pre selected site since it was not financed by the city land had to be purchased within the fairgrounds the investors had been unable to find suitable land and the search for a site was nearly dead when in they discovered a lot by ft by m containing switching equipment for the fire and police alarm systems the land sold for at this point only one year remained before the world s fair would begin the needle was privately financed and built by the pentagram corporation consisting of bagley wright contractor howard s wright architect john graham ned skinner and norton clapp in bagley skinner and clapp sold their interest to howard wright who now controls it under the name of space needle corporation the earthquake stability of the space needle was ensured when a hole was dug ft m deep and ft m across and concrete trucks took one full day to fill it the foundation weighs short tons metric tons including short tons or metric tons of reinforcing steel the same as the above ground structure the structure is bolted to the foundation with bolts each one ft m long with time an issue the construction team worked around the clock the domed top housing the top five levels including the restaurants and observation deck was perfectly balanced so that the restaurant could rotate with the help of one tiny electric motor originally kilowatts hp later replaced with a kilowatts hp motor with paint colors named orbital olive for the body astronaut white for the legs re entry red for the saucer and galaxy gold for the roof the space needle was finished in less than one year it was completed in april at a cost of million the last elevator car was installed the day before the fair opened on april during the course of the fair

            "cluster 0: initiative measure was a ballot measure in seattle washington regulating labor relations in the hotel industry that was passed by popular vote on november the initiative was placed on the ballot by UNITE HERE local a union that represents workers in the hospitality industry supporters of the measure see it as bringing a measure of justice to exploited workers opponents say the new law is unfair to guests too expensive to implement and unfairly advantages unions legislative history initiative measure was sponsored by UNITE HERE local stefan moritz a union official filed the initial text of the initiative with seattle s city clerk on april the union began collecting signatures to get the measure on the november ballot in may the final text of the initiative was filed on may the union submitted its petition signatures on june and king county elections issued a letter of sufficiency on july the final text of the ballot title was issued on july the measure passed on november and became a city ordinance with full effect on november after a proclamation by mayor ed murray provisions the initiative requires hotels with or more rooms to issue panic buttons to employees that work alone in guest rooms hotels are required to keep lists of guests accused of assault or harassment for five years from the date of the last accusation involving any given guest all relevant documents must be retained for the same period any guest accused of assault sexual assault or sexual harassment must be banned from the hotel for a minimum of three years a mere accusation is sufficient to require a ban no investigation is required there is no provision for appeals workers must be given paid time to make a police report and be given the option to work in a different area of the hotel police may only be contacted with the permission of the worker hotels are required to warn guests about these rules with a placard written in a large font placed on the interior side of their room doors under the initiative when a hotel is sold the new owners are required to offer employees of the previous owner work before hiring replacement staff this requirement applies from the day of sale until six months after the hotel is open to the public while under the management of the new employer if during the first days of operations the new owner finds that it needs fewer workers staff must be retained by order of seniority during this day period staff may not be otherwise dismissed except for cause workers must be provided with a written performance evaluation at the end of this period these records must be retained for at least three years conspicuous public notice of change of ownership including contact information for the new owners must be posted within five days after a sale is agreed to and must remain posted for six months after the hotel has been open to the public under new management this provision applies to hotels with rooms or more the initiative requires large hotels to limit the workload of cleaning staff to square feet per eight hour shift and regulates the handling of cleaning chemicals cleaners assigned space over this limit would be paid at time and a half wage this provision applies to hotels with rooms or more the initiative requires large hotels that don t offer health benefits to pay staff a monthly stipend to help them buy insurance qualifying workers would receive an amount based on their income family size the federal poverty line and the lowest premium offered on the washington health benefits exchange for a gold level policy this provision applies to hotels with or more rooms workers can enforce these rights by filing a complaint with the city of seattle or filing suit in king county superior court penalties issued against hotels go to the complainant affected workers and the city office of civil rights the measure prohibits employer retaliation for exercising any of these rights the law has a rebuttable presumption that any adverse action taken against an employee within days of exercising any of these rights is an act of illegal retaliation union shop exemption except for the provisions relating to assault sexual assault and sexual harassment every part of this measure can be waived in a union shop through collective bargaining debate opposition the seattle times editorial board opposed the initiative they wrote if the safety of seattle hotel employees is a problem the laws that protect them should be strengthened seattle ballot initiative is a sloppy possibly illegal first draft that should be rejected by voters support seattle weekly endorsed the initiative they wrote critics of the initiative largely hotel industry representatives call the measure s stipulations overreaching and draconian they say many hotels already have these kinds of protections in place they also point to i s union exemption clause if workers belong to a union their hotel will not be subject to some of the measure s stipulations to allow for freer collective bargaining we ourselves recognize that the union exemption may be faintly disguised self interest employers might find the law onerous leading them to encourage unionization in hopes of a better deal but if the byproduct of passing i is a stronger local union so be it we believe the result is a step toward justice for a long exploited class of workers union backed or no litigation the american hotel lodging association its washington state chapter and its seattle chapter all filed suit in washington state court to block initiative measure in december their complaint says the potential for mistakes and abuse is significant especially because the hotels are allowed no opportunity to determine whether there was actually any wrongdoing and guests are allowed no opportunity to refute the allegations the blacklist provision requires hotels to punish people by placing them on a list and denying some of them accommodations without any opportunity to investigate the allegations the suit also claimed that the initiative violated the single subject rule written into the seattle city charter the complaint says neither the ballot title nor the concise statement express the multiple subjects of initiative i particularly those which deal with compensation and fringe benefits legal standards for discrimination claims and the novel and disturbing requirement that hotels deny accommodation to certain guests without notice or a chance to respond to allegations on december a washington state court of appeals threw out i in its entirety holding that it unconstitutionally contains multiple unrelated topics after a king county superior court ruled in favor of the initiative the state supreme court last january declined to hear a direct appeal and sent it to the court of appeals for further review the appeals court found that i contains multiple separate parts including protecting workers who must enter guests hotel rooms from sexual harassment and assault by providing panic buttons and requiring hotels to maintain a list of guests who have been accused of sexual assault or harassment requiring hotel employers to provide and use safety devices and safeguards and prohibiting large hotels from requiring hotel workers to clean more than square feet per hour day without time and a half pay requiring large hotel employers to provide healthcare subsidies to hotel workers or the equivalent of a gold level healthcare policy when a hotel changes ownership requiring the new owner to hire from the list of employees prior to the sale for the first six months the statement for and against initiative is here see also hands off pants on references\n",

greece its speakers are referred to as pontic greeks or pontian greeks the linguistic lineage of pontic greek stems from ionic greek via koine and byzantine greek and contains influences from georgian russian turkish and armenian pontic greek is an endangered indo european language spoken by about people worldwide however only are considered active speakers although it is mainly spoken in northern greece it is also spoken in turkey russia armenia georgia and kazakhstan and by the pontic diaspora the language was brought to greece in the s after the population exchange between the christian pontic greeks and the turkish muslims from their homelands during the population exchange between greece and turkey however it is still spoken in pockets of the pontus today mostly by pontic greek muslims in the eastern districts of trabzon province pontic greek is considered a dialect of modern greek although reportedly the speakers of each do not fully understand each other it is primarily written in the greek script while in turkey and ukraine the latin script is used more frequently classification pontic greek is classified as an indo european greek language of the attic ionic branch name historically the speakers of pontic greek called it romeyka or romeika greek ρωμαίικα which in a more general sense is also a historical and colloquial term for modern greek as a whole the term pontic originated in scholarly usage but it has been adopted as a mark of identity by pontic greeks living in greece similarly in turkish the language is called rumca pronounced ˈɾumd ʒa derived from the turkish word rum denoting ethnic greeks living in turkey in general the term also includes other greek speakers in turkey such as those from istanbul or imbros gökçeada who speak a language close to standard modern greek today s pontic speakers living in turkey call their language romeyka rumca or rumcika history similar to most modern greek dialects pontic greek is mainly derived from koine greek which was spoken in the hellenistic and roman times between the th century BC and the th century AD following the seljuk invasion of asia minor during the th century AD pontus became isolated from many of the regions of the byzantine empire the pontians remained somewhat isolated from the mainland greeks causing pontic greek to develop separately and distinctly from the rest of the mainland greek however the language has also been influenced by the nearby persian caucasian and turkish languages dialects greek linguist manolis triantafyllidis has divided the pontic of turkey into two groups the western group oinountiac or niotika around oenoe turkish ünye the eastern group which is again subdivided into the coastal subgroup trapezountiac around trebizond ancient greek trapezous and the inland subgroup chaldiot in chaldia around argyroupolis gümüşhane and kanin in pontic its vicinity kelkit baibourt etc and around kotyora ordu speakers of chaldiot were the most numerous in phonology some varieties of pontic are reported to demonstrate vowel harmony a well known feature of turkish mirambel outside turkey one can distinguish the northern group mariupol greek or rumeíka originally spoken in crimea but now principally in mariupol where the majority of crimean pontic greeks of the rumaiic subgroup now live other pontic greeks speak crimean tatar as their mother tongue and are classified as urums there are approximately half a dozen dialects of crimean mariupolitan pontic greek spoken soviet rumaiic a soviet variant of the pontic greek language spoken by the pontic greek population of the soviet union ophitic the inhabitants of the of valley who had converted to islam in the th century remained in turkey and have partly retained the pontic language until today their dialect which forms part of the trapezountiac subgroup is called ophitic by linguists but speakers generally call it romeyka as few as people are reported to speak it there are however estimates that show the real number of the speakers as considerably higher speakers of ophitic romeyka are concentrated in the eastern districts of trabzon province çaykara katohor dernekpazarı kondu sürmene sourmena and köprübaşı göneşera although less widespread it is still spoken in some remote villages of the of district itself it is also spoken in the western i̇kizdere dipotamos district of rize province historically the dialect was spoken in a wider area stretching further east to the port town of athina pazar ophitic has retained the infinitive which is present in ancient greek but has been lost in other variants of modern greek it has therefore been characterized as archaic or conservative even in relation to other pontic dialects and as the living language that is closest to ancient greek a very similar dialect is spoken by descendants of christians from the of valley especially from kondu now living in greece in the village of nea trapezounta pieria central macedonia with about speakers geographic distribution though pontic was originally spoken on the southern shores of the black sea from the th and th century and on substantial numbers migrated into the northern and eastern shores into the russian empire pontic is still spoken by large numbers of people in ukraine mainly in mariupol but also in other parts of ukraine such as the odessa and donetsk region in russia around stavropol and georgia the language enjoyed some use as a literary medium in the s including a school grammar topkharas after the massacres of the s the majority of speakers remaining in asia minor were subject to the treaty of lausanne population exchange and were resettled in greece mainly northern greece a second wave of migration occurred in the early s this time from countries of the former soviet union in greece pontic is now many times used only emblematically rather than as a medium of communication due to the mixing of pontic and other greeks greece

later revival of greek identity in the soviet union and post communist russia saw a renewed division on the issue of rumaiic versus demotic a new attempt to preserve a sense of ethnic rumaiic identity started in the mid s the ukrainian scholar andriy biletsky created a new slavonic alphabet but though a number of writers and poets make use of this alphabet the population of the region rarely uses

            "cluster 1: arvanitika arvanitika αρbε ρίσ τ romanized arbërisht greek αρβανίτικα romanized arvanítika also known as arvanitic is the variety of albanian traditionally spoken by the arvanites a population group in greece arvanitika is today endangered as its speakers have been shifting to the use of greek and most younger members of the community no longer speak it name the name arvanítika and its native equivalent arbërisht are derived from the ethnonym arvanites which in turn comes from the toponym arbëna greek άρβανα which in the middle ages referred to a region in what is today albania its native equivalents arbërorë arbëreshë and others used to be the self designation of albanians in general in the past arvanitika had sometimes been described as graeco albanian and the like e g furikis although today many arvanites consider such names offensive they generally identify nationally and ethnically as greeks and not albanians classification arvanitika was brought to southern greece during the late middle ages by settlers from what is today albania arvanitika is also closely related to arbëresh the dialect of albanian in italy which largely goes back to arvanite settlers from greece italian arbëresh has retained some words borrowed from greek for instance haristis thank you from ευχαριστώ dhrom road from δρόμος ne yes from ναι in certain villages italo arbëresh and graeco arvanitika have a mutually intelligible vocabulary base the unintelligible elements of the two dialects stem from the usage of italian or greek modernisms in the absence of native ones while linguistic scholarship unanimously describes arvanitika as a dialect of albanian many arvanites are reported to dislike the use of the name albanian to designate it as it carries the connotation of albanian nationality and is thus felt to call their greek identity into question sociolinguistic work has described arvanitika within the conceptual framework of ausbausprachen and abstandssprachen in terms of abstand objective difference of the linguistic systems linguists assessment of the degree of mutual intelligibility between arvanitika and standard tosk range from fairly high to only partial ethnologue the ethnologue also mentions that mutual intelligibility may even be problematic between different subdialects within arvanitika mutual intelligibility between standard tosk and arvanitika is higher than that between the two main dialect groups within albanian tosk and gheg see below for a sample text in the three language forms trudgill sums up that l inguistically there is no doubt that arvanitika is a variety of albanian in terms of ausbau sociolinguistic upgrading towards an autonomous standard language the strongest indicator of autonomy is the existence of a separate writing system the greek based arvanitic alphabet a very similar system was formerly in use also by other tosk albanian speakers between the th and th century however this script is very rarely used in practice today as arvanitika is almost exclusively a spoken language confined to the private sphere there is also some disagreement amongst arvanites as with the aromanians as to whether the latin alphabet should be used to write their language spoken arvanitika is internally richly diversified into sub dialects and no further standardization towards a common spoken or written standard arvanitika has taken place at the same time arvanites do not use standard albanian as their standard language either as they are generally not literate in the latin based standard albanian orthography and are not reported to use spoken language media in standard albanian in this sense then arvanitika is not functionally subordinated to standard albanian as a dachsprache roof language in the way dialects of a national language within the same country usually are geographic distribution there are three main groups of arvanitic settlements in greece most arvanites live in the south of greece across attica boeotia the peloponnese and some neighbouring areas and islands a second smaller group live in the northwest of greece in a zone contiguous with the albanian speaking lands proper a third outlying group is found in the northeast of greece in a few villages in thrace according to some authors the term arvanitika in its proper sense applies only to the southern group or to the southern and the thracian groups together i e to those dialects that have been separated from the core of albanian for several centuries the dialects in the northwest are reported to be more similar to neighbouring tosk dialects within albania and to the speech of the former muslim cham albanians çamërishte who used to live in the same region these dialects are classified by ethnologue as part of core tosk albanian as opposed to arvanitika albanian in the narrow sense although ethnologue notes that the term arvanitika is also often applied indiscriminately to both forms in greece in their own language some groups in the north west are reported to use the term shqip albanian language to refer to their own language as well as to that of albanian nationals and this has sometimes been interpreted as implying that they are ethnically albanians the arvanitika of southern greece is richly sub divided into local dialects sasse distinguishes as many as eleven dialect groups within that area west attic southeast attic northeast attic boeotian west boeotian central boeotian northeast peloponnesian northwest peloponnesian south peloponnesian west peloponnesian euboean and andriote estimated numbers of speakers of arvanitika vary widely between and these figures include terminal speakers tsitsipis of the younger generation who have only acquired an imperfect command of the language and are unlikely to pass it on to future generations the number of villages with traditional arvanite populations is estimated to more than there are no monolingual arvanitika speakers as all are today bilingual in greek arvanitika is considered an endangered language due to the large scale language shift towards greek among the descendants of arvanitika speakers in recent decades characteristics arvanitika shares many features with the tosk dialect spoken in southern albania however it has received a great deal of influence from greek mostly related to the vocabulary and the phonological system at the same time it is reported to have preserved some conservative features that were lost in mainstream albanian tosk for example it has preserved certain syllable initial consonant clusters which have been simplified in standard albanian cf arvanitika gljuhë ˈɡljuhə language tongue vs standard albanian gjuhë ˈɟuhə in recent times linguists have observed signs of accelerated structural convergence towards greek and structural simplification of the language which have been interpreted as signs of language attrition i e effects of impoverishment leading towards language death writing system arvanitika has rarely been written reportedly GHM it has been written in both the greek alphabet often with the addition of the letters b d e and j or diacritics e g and

            "cluster 2: a supernova plural supernovae or supernovas abbreviations SN and sne is a powerful and luminous stellar explosion this transient astronomical event occurs during the last evolutionary stages of a massive star or when a white dwarf is triggered into runaway nuclear fusion the original object called the progenitor either collapses to a neutron star or black hole or is completely destroyed the peak optical luminosity of a supernova can be comparable to that of an entire galaxy before fading over several weeks or months supernovae are more energetic than novae in latin nova means new referring astronomically to what appears to be a temporary new bright star adding the prefix super distinguishes supernovae from ordinary novae which are far less luminous the word supernova was coined by walter baade and fritz zwicky in the most recent directly observed supernova in the milky way was kepler s supernova in but the remnants of more recent supernovae have been found observations of supernovae in other galaxies suggest they occur in the milky way on average about three times every century these supernovae would almost certainly be observable with modern astronomical telescopes the most recent naked eye supernova was SN a the explosion of a blue supergiant star in the large magellanic cloud a satellite of the milky way theoretical studies indicate that most supernovae are triggered by one of two basic mechanisms the sudden re ignition of nuclear fusion in a degenerate star such as a white dwarf or the sudden gravitational collapse of a massive star s core in the first class of events the object s temperature is raised enough to trigger runaway nuclear fusion completely disrupting the star possible causes are an accumulation of material from a binary companion through accretion or a stellar merger in the massive star case the core of a massive star may undergo sudden collapse releasing gravitational potential energy as a supernova while some observed supernovae are more complex than these two simplified theories the astrophysical mechanics are established and accepted by the astronomical community supernovae can expel several solar masses of material at speeds up to several percent of the speed of light this drives an expanding shock wave into the surrounding interstellar medium sweeping up an expanding shell of gas and dust observed as a supernova remnant supernovae are a major source of elements in the interstellar medium from oxygen to rubidium the expanding shock waves of supernovae can trigger the formation of new stars supernova remnants might be a major source of cosmic rays supernovae might produce gravitational waves though thus far gravitational waves have been detected only from the mergers of black holes and neutron stars observation history compared to a star s entire history the visual appearance of a supernova is very brief perhaps spanning several months so that the chances of observing one with the naked eye is roughly once in a lifetime only a tiny fraction of the billion stars in a typical galaxy have the capacity to become a supernova restricted to either those having large mass or extraordinarily rare kinds of binary stars containing white dwarfs the earliest possible recorded supernova known as HB could have been viewed and recorded by unknown indian observers in BC later SN was viewed by chinese astronomers in AD the brightest recorded supernova was SN which occurred in AD in the constellation of lupus and was described by observers across china japan iraq egypt and europe the widely observed supernova SN produced the crab nebula supernovae SN and SN the latest to be observed with the naked eye in the milky way galaxy had notable effects on the development of astronomy in europe because they were used to argue against the aristotelian idea that the universe beyond the moon and planets was static and unchanging johannes kepler began observing SN at its peak on october and continued to make estimates of its brightness until it faded from naked eye view a year later it was the second supernova to be observed in a generation after SN seen by tycho brahe in cassiopeia there is some evidence that the youngest galactic supernova g occurred in the late th century considerably more recently than cassiopeia a from around neither supernova was noted at the time in the case of g high extinction along the plane of the galaxy could have dimmed the event sufficiently to go unnoticed the situation for cassiopeia a is less clear infrared light echos have been detected showing that it was a type iib supernova and was not in a region of especially high extinction observation and discovery of extragalactic supernovae are now far more common the first such observation was of SN a in the andromeda galaxy today amateur and professional astronomers are finding several hundred every year some when near maximum brightness others on old astronomical photographs or plates american astronomers rudolph minkowski and fritz zwicky developed the modern supernova classification scheme beginning in during the s astronomers found that the maximum intensities of supernovae could be used as standard candles hence indicators of astronomical distances some of the most distant supernovae observed in appeared dimmer than expected this supports the view that the expansion of the universe is accelerating techniques were developed for reconstructing supernovae events that have no written records of being observed the date of the cassiopeia a supernova event was determined from light echoes off nebulae while the age of supernova remnant RX j was estimated from temperature measurements and the gamma ray emissions from the radioactive decay of titanium the most luminous supernova ever recorded is ASASSN lh at a distance of gigalight years it was first detected in june and peaked at billion l which is twice the bolometric luminosity of any other known supernova however the nature of this supernova continues to be debated and several alternative explanations have been suggested e g tidal disruption of a star by a black hole among the earliest detected since time of detonation and for which the earliest spectra have been obtained beginning at hours after the actual explosion is the type II SN fs iptf dqy which was recorded hours after the supernova event on october by the intermediate palomar transient factory iptf the star is located in a spiral galaxy named NGC million light years away in the constellation of pegasus on september amateur astronomer victor buso from rosario argentina was testing his telescope when taking several photographs of galaxy NGC buso chanced upon a supernova that had just become visible on earth after examining the images he contacted the instituto de astrofísica de la plata it was the first time anyone had ever captured the initial moments of the shock breakout from an optical supernova one not associated with a gamma ray or x ray burst the odds of capturing such an event were put between one in ten million to one in a hundred million according to astronomer melina bersten from the instituto de astrofísica the supernova buso observed was a type iib made by a star twenty times the mass of the sun astronomer alex filippenko from the university of california remarked that professional astronomers had been searching for such an event for a long time he stated observations of stars in the first moments they begin exploding provide information that cannot be directly obtained in any other way discovery early work on what was originally believed to be simply a new category of novae was performed during the s these were variously called upper class novae hauptnovae or giant novae the name supernovae is thought to have been coined by walter baade and fritz zwicky in lectures at caltech during it was used as super novae in a journal paper published by knut lundmark in and in a paper by baade and zwicky by the hyphen had been lost and the modern name was in use because supernovae are relatively rare events within a galaxy occurring about three times a century in the milky way obtaining a good sample of supernovae to study requires regular monitoring of many galaxies supernovae in other galaxies cannot be predicted with any meaningful accuracy normally when they are discovered they are already in progress to use supernovae as standard candles for measuring distance observation of their peak luminosity is required it is therefore important to discover them well before they reach their maximum amateur astronomers who greatly outnumber professional astronomers have played an important role in finding supernovae typically by looking at some of the closer galaxies through an optical telescope and comparing them to earlier photographs toward the end of the th century astronomers increasingly turned to computer controlled telescopes and ccds for hunting supernovae while such systems are popular with amateurs there are also professional installations such as the katzman automatic imaging telescope the supernova early warning system SNEWS project uses a network of neutrino detectors to give early warning of a supernova in the milky way galaxy neutrinos are particles that are produced in great quantities by a supernova and they are not significantly absorbed by the interstellar gas and dust of the galactic disk supernova searches fall into two classes those focused on relatively nearby events and those looking farther away because of the expansion of the universe the distance to a remote object with a known emission spectrum can be estimated by measuring its doppler shift or redshift on average more distant objects recede with greater velocity than those nearby and so have a higher redshift thus the search is split between high redshift and low redshift with the boundary falling around a redshift range of z where z is a dimensionless measure of the spectrum s frequency shift high redshift searches for supernovae usually involve the observation of supernova light curves these are useful for standard or calibrated candles to generate hubble diagrams and make cosmological predictions supernova spectroscopy used to study the physics and environments of supernovae is more practical at low than at high redshift low redshift observations also anchor the low distance end of the hubble curve which is a plot of distance versus redshift for visible galaxies naming convention supernova discoveries are reported to the international astronomical union s central bureau for astronomical telegrams which sends out a circular with the name it assigns to that supernova the name is formed from the prefix SN followed by the year of discovery suffixed with a one or two letter designation the first supernovae of the year are designated with a capital letter from a to z afterward pairs of lower case letters are used aa ab and so on hence for example SN c designates the third supernova reported in the year the last supernova of SN nc was the th the suffix nc acts as a bijective base encoding with a b c z since professional and amateur astronomers have been finding several hundreds of supernovae each year in in in in historical supernovae are known simply by the year they occurred SN SN SN SN called tycho s nova and SN kepler s star since the additional letter notation has been used even if there was only one supernova discovered that year e g SN a SN a etc this last happened with SN a SN for supernova is a standard prefix until two letter designations were rarely needed since however they have been needed every year since the increasing number of discoveries has regularly led to the additional use of three digit designations classification astronomers classify supernovae according to their light curves and the absorption lines of different chemical elements that appear in their spectra if a supernova s spectrum contains lines of hydrogen known as the balmer series in the visual portion of the spectrum it is classified type II otherwise it is type i in each of these two types there are subdivisions according to the presence of lines from other elements or the shape of the light curve a graph of the supernova s apparent magnitude as a function of time type i type i supernovae are subdivided on the basis of their spectra with type ia showing a strong ionised silicon absorption line type i supernovae without this strong line are classified as type ib and ic with type ib showing strong neutral helium lines and type ic lacking them the light curves are all similar although type ia are generally brighter at peak luminosity but the light curve is not important for classification of type i supernovae a small number of type ia supernovae exhibit unusual features such as non standard luminosity or broadened light curves and these are typically classified by referring to the earliest example showing similar features for example the sub luminous SN ha is often referred to as SN cx like or class ia cx a small proportion of type ic supernovae show highly broadened and blended emission lines which are taken to indicate very high expansion velocities for the ejecta these have been classified as type ic BL or ic bl type II the supernovae of type II can also be sub divided based on their spectra while most type II supernovae show very broad emission lines which indicate expansion velocities of many thousands of kilometres per second some such as SN gl have relatively narrow features in their spectra these are called type iin where the n stands for narrow a few supernovae such as SN k and SN j appear to change types they show lines of hydrogen at early times but over a period of weeks to months become dominated by lines of helium the term type iib is used to describe the combination of features normally associated with types II and ib type II supernovae with normal spectra dominated by broad hydrogen lines that remain for the life of the decline are classified on the basis of their light curves the most common type shows a distinctive plateau in the light curve shortly after peak brightness where the visual luminosity stays relatively constant for several months before the decline resumes these are called type II p referring to the plateau less common are type II l supernovae that lack a distinct plateau the l signifies linear although the light curve is not actually a straight line supernovae that do not fit into the normal classifications are designated peculiar or pec types III IV and v fritz zwicky defined additional supernovae types based on a very few examples that did not cleanly fit the parameters for type i or type II supernovae SN i in NGC was the prototype and only member of the type III supernova class noted for its broad light curve maximum and broad hydrogen balmer lines that were slow to develop in the spectrum SN f in NGC was the prototype and only member of the type IV class with a light curve similar to a type II p supernova with hydrogen absorption lines but weak hydrogen emission lines the type v class was coined for SN v in NGC an unusual faint supernova or supernova impostor with a slow rise to brightness a maximum lasting many months and an unusual emission spectrum the similarity of SN v to the eta carinae great outburst was noted supernovae in m and m and were also suggested as possible type IV or type v supernovae these types would now all be treated as peculiar type II supernovae iipec of which many more examples have been discovered although it is still debated whether SN v was a true supernova following an LBV outburst or an impostor current models supernovae type codes as described above are taxonomic the type number describes the light observed from the supernova not necessarily its cause for example type ia supernovae are produced by runaway fusion ignited on degenerate white dwarf progenitors while the spectrally similar type ib c are produced from massive wolf rayet progenitors by core collapse the following summarises what is currently believed to be the most plausible explanations for supernovae thermal runaway a white dwarf star may accumulate sufficient material from a stellar companion to raise its core temperature enough to ignite carbon fusion at which point it undergoes runaway nuclear fusion completely disrupting it there are three avenues by which this detonation is theorised to happen stable accretion of material from a companion the collision of two white dwarfs or accretion that causes ignition in a shell that then ignites the core the dominant mechanism by which type ia supernovae are produced remains unclear despite this uncertainty in how type ia supernovae are produced type ia supernovae have very uniform properties and are useful standard candles over intergalactic distances some calibrations are required to compensate for the gradual change in properties or different frequencies of abnormal luminosity supernovae at high redshift and for small variations in brightness identified by light curve shape or spectrum normal type ia there are several means by which a supernova of this type can form but they share a common underlying mechanism if a carbon oxygen white dwarf accreted enough matter to reach the chandrasekhar limit of about solar masses m for a non rotating star it would no longer be able to support the bulk of its mass through electron degeneracy pressure and would begin to collapse however the current view is that this limit is not normally attained increasing temperature and density inside the core ignite carbon fusion as the star approaches the limit to within about before collapse is initiated for a core primarily composed of oxygen neon and magnesium the collapsing white dwarf will typically form a neutron star in this case only a fraction of the star s mass will be ejected during the collapse within a few seconds a substantial fraction of the matter in the white dwarf undergoes nuclear fusion releasing enough energy j to unbind the star in a supernova an outwardly expanding shock wave is generated with matter reaching velocities on the order of km s or roughly of the speed of light there is also a significant increase in luminosity reaching an absolute magnitude of or billion times brighter than the sun with little variation the model for the formation of this category of supernova is a close binary star system the larger of the two stars is the first to evolve off the main sequence and it expands to form a red giant the two stars now share a common envelope causing their mutual orbit to shrink the giant star then sheds most of its envelope losing mass until it can no longer continue nuclear fusion at this point it becomes a white dwarf star composed primarily of carbon and oxygen eventually the secondary star also evolves off the main sequence to form a red giant matter from the giant is accreted by the white dwarf causing the latter to increase in mass despite widespread acceptance of the basic model the exact details of initiation and of the heavy elements produced in the catastrophic event are still unclear type ia supernovae follow a characteristic light curve the graph of luminosity as a function of time after the event this luminosity is generated by the radioactive decay of nickel through cobalt to iron the peak luminosity of the light curve is extremely consistent across normal type ia supernovae having a maximum absolute magnitude of about this is because type ia supernovae arise from a consistent type of progenitor star by gradual mass acquisition and explode when they acquire a consistent typical mass giving rise to very similar supernova conditions and behavior this allows them to be used as a secondary standard candle to measure the distance to their host galaxies non standard type ia another model for the formation of type ia supernovae involves the merger of two white dwarf stars with the combined mass momentarily exceeding the chandrasekhar limit there is much variation in this type of event and in many cases there may be no supernova at all in which case they will have a broader and less luminous light curve than the more normal SN type ia abnormally bright type ia supernovae occur when the white dwarf already has a mass higher than the chandrasekhar limit possibly enhanced further by asymmetry but the ejected material will have less than normal kinetic energy there is no formal sub classification for the non standard type ia supernovae it has been proposed that a group of sub luminous supernovae that occur when helium accretes onto a white dwarf should be classified as type iax this type of supernova may not always completely destroy the white dwarf progenitor and could leave behind a zombie star one specific type of non standard type ia supernova develops hydrogen and other emission lines and gives the appearance of mixture between a normal type ia and a type iin supernova examples are SN ic and SN gj these supernovae have been dubbed type ia iin type ian type iia and type iian core collapse very massive stars can undergo core collapse when nuclear fusion becomes unable to sustain the core against its own gravity passing this threshold is the cause of all types of supernova except type ia the collapse may cause violent expulsion of the outer layers of the star resulting in a supernova or the release of gravitational potential energy may be insufficient and the star may collapse into a black hole or neutron star with little radiated energy core collapse can be caused by several different mechanisms electron capture exceeding the chandrasekhar limit pair instability or photodisintegration when a massive star develops an iron core larger than the chandrasekhar mass it will no longer be able to support itself by electron degeneracy pressure and will collapse further to a neutron star or black hole electron capture by magnesium in a degenerate o ne mg core causes gravitational collapse followed by explosive oxygen fusion with very similar results electron positron pair production in a large post helium burning core removes thermodynamic support and causes initial collapse followed by runaway fusion resulting in a pair instability supernova a sufficiently large and hot stellar core may generate gamma rays energetic enough to initiate photodisintegration directly which will cause a complete collapse of the core the table below lists the known reasons for core collapse in massive stars the types of stars in which they occur their associated supernova type and the remnant produced the metallicity is the proportion of elements other than hydrogen or helium as compared to the sun the initial mass is the mass of the star prior to the supernova event given in multiples of the sun s mass although the mass at the time of the supernova may be much lower type iin supernovae are not listed in the table they can be produced by various types of core collapse in different progenitor stars possibly even by type ia white dwarf ignitions although it seems that most will be from iron core collapse in luminous supergiants or hypergiants including lbvs the narrow spectral lines for which they are named occur because the supernova is expanding into a small dense cloud of circumstellar material it appears that a significant proportion of supposed type iin supernovae are supernova impostors massive eruptions of LBV like stars similar to the great eruption of eta carinae in these events material previously ejected from the star creates the narrow absorption lines and causes a shock wave through interaction with the newly ejected material when a stellar core is no longer supported against gravity it collapses in on itself with velocities reaching km s c resulting in a rapid increase in temperature and density what follows next depends on the mass and structure of the collapsing core with low mass degenerate cores forming neutron stars higher mass degenerate cores mostly collapsing completely to black holes and non degenerate cores undergoing runaway fusion the initial collapse of degenerate cores is accelerated by beta decay photodisintegration and electron capture which causes a burst of electron neutrinos as the density increases neutrino emission is cut off as they become trapped in the core the inner core eventually reaches typically km in diameter and a density comparable to that of an atomic nucleus and neutron degeneracy pressure tries to halt the collapse if the core mass is more than about m then neutron degeneracy is insufficient to stop the collapse and a black hole forms directly with no supernova in lower mass cores the collapse is stopped and the newly formed neutron core has an initial temperature of about billion kelvin times the temperature of the sun s core at this temperature neutrino antineutrino pairs of all flavours are efficiently formed by thermal emission these thermal neutrinos are several times more abundant than the electron capture neutrinos about joules approximately of the star s rest mass is converted into a ten second burst of neutrinos which is the main output of the event the suddenly halted core collapse rebounds and produces a shock wave that stalls within milliseconds in the outer core as energy is lost through the dissociation of heavy elements a process that is not clearly understood is necessary to allow the outer layers of the core to reabsorb around joules foe from the neutrino pulse producing the visible brightness although there are also other theories on how to power the explosion some material from the outer envelope falls back onto the neutron star and for cores beyond about m there is sufficient fallback to form a black hole this fallback will reduce the kinetic energy created and the mass of expelled radioactive material but in some situations it may also generate relativistic jets that result in a gamma ray burst or an exceptionally luminous supernova the collapse of a massive non degenerate core will ignite further fusion when the core collapse is initiated by pair instability oxygen fusion begins and the collapse may be halted for core masses of m the collapse halts and the star remains intact but collapse will occur again when a larger core has formed for cores of around m the fusion of oxygen and heavier elements is so energetic that the entire star is disrupted causing a supernova at the upper end of the mass range the supernova is unusually luminous and extremely long lived due to many solar masses of ejected ni for even larger core masses the core temperature becomes high enough to allow photodisintegration and the core collapses completely into a black hole type II stars with initial masses less than about m never develop a core large enough to collapse and they eventually lose their atmospheres to become white dwarfs stars with at least m possibly as much as m evolve in a complex fashion progressively burning heavier elements at hotter temperatures in their cores the star becomes layered like an onion with the burning of more easily fused elements occurring in larger shells although popularly described as an onion with an iron core the least massive supernova progenitors only have oxygen neon magnesium cores these super AGB stars may form the majority of core collapse supernovae although less luminous and so less commonly observed than those from more massive progenitors if core collapse occurs during a supergiant phase when the star still has a hydrogen envelope the result is a type II supernova the rate of mass loss for luminous stars depends on the metallicity and luminosity extremely luminous stars at near solar metallicity will lose all their hydrogen before they reach core collapse and so will not form a type II supernova at low metallicity all stars will reach core collapse with a hydrogen envelope but sufficiently massive stars collapse directly to a black hole without producing a visible supernova stars with an initial mass up to about times the sun or a little less at high metallicity result in a type II p supernova which is the most commonly observed type at moderate to high metallicity stars near the upper end of that mass range will have lost most of their hydrogen when core collapse occurs and the result will be a type II l supernova at very low metallicity stars of around m will reach core collapse by pair instability while they still have a hydrogen atmosphere and an oxygen core and the result will be a supernova with type II characteristics but a very large mass of ejected ni and high luminosity type ib and ic these supernovae like those of type II are massive stars that undergo core collapse however the stars which become types ib and ic supernovae have lost most of their outer hydrogen envelopes due to strong stellar winds or else from interaction with a companion these stars are known as wolf rayet stars and they occur at moderate to high metallicity where continuum driven winds cause sufficiently high mass loss rates observations of type ib c supernova do not match the observed or expected occurrence of wolf rayet stars and alternate explanations for this type of core collapse supernova involve stars stripped of their hydrogen by binary interactions binary models provide a better match for the observed supernovae with the proviso that no suitable binary helium stars have ever been observed since a supernova can occur whenever the mass of the star at the time of core collapse is low enough not to cause complete fallback to a black hole any massive star may result in a supernova if it loses enough mass before core collapse occurs type ib supernovae are the more common and result from wolf rayet stars of type WC which still have helium in their atmospheres for a narrow range of masses stars evolve further before reaching core collapse to become WO stars with very little helium remaining and these are the progenitors of type ic supernovae a few percent of the type ic supernovae are associated with gamma ray bursts GRB though it is also believed that any hydrogen stripped type ib or ic supernova could produce a GRB depending on the circumstances of the geometry the mechanism for producing this type of GRB is the jets produced by the magnetic field of the rapidly spinning magnetar formed at the collapsing core of the star the jets would also transfer energy into the expanding outer shell producing a super luminous supernova ultra stripped supernovae occur when the exploding star has been stripped almost all the way to the metal core via mass transfer in a close binary as a result very little material is ejected from the exploding star c m in the most extreme cases ultra stripped supernovae can occur in naked metal cores barely above the chandrasekhar mass limit SN ek might be an observational example of an ultra stripped supernova giving rise to a relatively dim and fast decaying light curve the nature of ultra stripped supernovae can be both iron core collapse and electron capture supernovae depending on the mass of the collapsing core failed supernovae the core collapse of some massive stars may not result in a visible supernova the main model for this is a sufficiently massive core that the kinetic energy is insufficient to reverse the infall of the outer layers onto a black hole these events are difficult to detect but large surveys have detected possible candidates the red supergiant n BH in NGC underwent a modest outburst in march before fading from view only a faint infrared source remains at the star s location light curves a historic puzzle concerned the source of energy that can maintain the optical supernova glow for months although the energy that disrupts each type of supernovae is delivered promptly the light curves are dominated by subsequent radioactive heating of the rapidly expanding ejecta some have considered rotational energy from the central pulsar the ejecta gases would dim quickly without some energy input to keep it hot the intensely radioactive nature of the ejecta gases which is now known to be correct for most supernovae was first calculated on sound nucleosynthesis grounds in the late s it was not until SN a that direct observation of gamma ray lines unambiguously identified the major radioactive nuclei it is now known by direct observation that much of the light curve the graph of luminosity as a function of time after the occurrence of a type II supernova such as SN a is explained by those predicted radioactive decays although the luminous emission consists of optical photons it is the radioactive power absorbed by the ejected gases that keeps the remnant hot enough to radiate light the radioactive decay of ni through its daughters co to fe produces gamma ray photons primarily of kev and kev that are absorbed and dominate the heating and thus the luminosity of the ejecta at intermediate times several weeks to late times several months energy for the peak of the light curve of SN a was provided by the decay of ni to co half life days while energy for the later light curve in particular fit very closely with the day half life of co decaying to fe later measurements by space gamma ray telescopes of the small fraction of the co and co gamma rays that escaped the SN a remnant without absorption confirmed earlier predictions that those two radioactive nuclei were the power sources the visual light curves of the different supernova types all depend at late times on radioactive heating but they vary in shape and amplitude because of the underlying mechanisms the way that visible radiation is produced the epoch of its observation and the transparency of the ejected material the light curves can be significantly different at other wavelengths for example at ultraviolet wavelengths there is an early extremely luminous peak lasting only a few hours corresponding to the breakout of the shock launched by the initial event but that breakout is hardly detectable optically the light curves for type ia are mostly very uniform with a consistent maximum absolute magnitude and a relatively steep decline in luminosity their optical energy output is driven by radioactive decay of ejected nickel half life days which then decays to radioactive cobalt half life days these radioisotopes excite the surrounding material to incandescence studies of cosmology today rely on ni radioactivity providing the energy for the optical brightness of supernovae of type ia which are the standard candles of cosmology but whose diagnostic kev and kev gamma rays were first detected only in the initial phases of the light curve decline steeply as the effective size of the photosphere decreases and trapped electromagnetic radiation is depleted the light curve continues to decline in the b band while it may show a small shoulder in the visual at about days but this is only a hint of a secondary maximum that occurs in the infra red as certain ionised heavy elements recombine to produce infra red radiation and the ejecta become transparent to it the visual light curve continues to decline at a rate slightly greater than the decay rate of the radioactive cobalt which has the longer half life and controls the later curve because the ejected material becomes more diffuse and less able to convert the high energy radiation into visual radiation after several months the light curve changes its decline rate again as positron emission becomes dominant from the remaining cobalt although this portion of the light curve has been little studied type ib and ic light curves are basically similar to type ia although with a lower average peak luminosity the visual light output is again due to radioactive decay being converted into visual radiation but there is a much lower mass of the created nickel the peak luminosity varies considerably and there are even occasional type ib c supernovae orders of magnitude more and less luminous than the norm the most luminous type ic supernovae are referred to as hypernovae and tend to have broadened light curves in addition to the increased peak luminosity the source of the extra energy is thought to be relativistic jets driven by the formation of a rotating black hole which also produce gamma ray bursts the light curves for type II supernovae are characterised by a much slower decline than type i on the order of magnitudes per day excluding the plateau phase the visual light output is dominated by kinetic energy rather than radioactive decay for several months due primarily to the existence of hydrogen in the ejecta from the atmosphere of the supergiant progenitor star in the initial destruction this hydrogen becomes heated and ionised the majority of type II supernovae show a prolonged plateau in their light curves as this hydrogen recombines emitting visible light and becoming more transparent this is then followed by a declining light curve driven by radioactive decay although slower than in type i supernovae due to the efficiency of conversion into light by all the hydrogen in type II l the plateau is absent because the progenitor had relatively little hydrogen left in its atmosphere sufficient to appear in the spectrum but insufficient to produce a noticeable plateau in the light output in type iib supernovae the hydrogen atmosphere of the progenitor is so depleted thought to be due to tidal stripping by a companion star that the light curve is closer to a type i supernova and the hydrogen even disappears from the spectrum after several weeks type iin supernovae are characterised by additional narrow spectral lines produced in a dense shell of circumstellar material their light curves are generally very broad and extended occasionally also extremely luminous and referred to as a superluminous supernova these light curves are produced by the highly efficient conversion of kinetic energy of the ejecta into electromagnetic radiation by interaction with the dense shell of material this only occurs when the material is sufficiently dense and compact indicating that it has been produced by the progenitor star itself only shortly before the supernova occurs large numbers of supernovae have been catalogued and classified to provide distance candles and test models average characteristics vary somewhat with distance and type of host galaxy but can broadly be specified for each supernova type notes asymmetry a long standing puzzle surrounding type II supernovae is why the remaining compact object receives a large velocity away from the epicentre pulsars and thus neutron stars are observed to have high velocities and black holes presumably do as well although they are far harder to observe in isolation the initial impetus can be substantial propelling an object of more than a solar mass at a velocity of km s or greater this indicates an expansion asymmetry but the mechanism by which momentum is transferred to the compact object remains a puzzle proposed explanations for this kick include convection in the collapsing star and jet production during neutron star formation one possible explanation for this asymmetry is large scale convection above the core the convection can create variations in the local abundances of elements resulting in uneven nuclear burning during the collapse bounce and resulting expansion another possible explanation is that accretion of gas onto the central neutron star can create a disk that drives highly directional jets propelling matter at a high velocity out of the star and driving transverse shocks that completely disrupt the star these jets might play a crucial role in the resulting supernova a similar model is now favored for explaining long gamma ray bursts initial asymmetries have also been confirmed in type ia supernovae through observation this result may mean that the initial luminosity of this type of supernova depends on the viewing angle however the expansion becomes more symmetrical with the passage of time early asymmetries are detectable by measuring the polarization of the emitted light energy output although supernovae are primarily known as luminous events the electromagnetic radiation they release is almost a minor side effect particularly in the case of core collapse supernovae the emitted electromagnetic radiation is a tiny fraction of the total energy released during the event there is a fundamental difference between the balance of energy production in the different types of supernova in type ia white dwarf detonations most of the energy is directed into heavy element synthesis and the kinetic energy of the ejecta in core collapse supernovae the vast majority of the energy is directed into neutrino emission and while some of this apparently powers the observed destruction of the neutrinos escape the star in the first few minutes following the start of the collapse type ia supernovae derive their energy from a runaway nuclear fusion of a carbon oxygen white dwarf the details of the energetics are still not fully understood but the end result is the ejection of the entire mass of the original star at high kinetic energy around half a solar mass of that mass is ni generated from silicon burning ni is radioactive and decays into co by beta plus decay with a half life of six days and gamma rays co itself decays by the beta plus positron path with a half life of days into stable fe these two processes are responsible for the electromagnetic radiation from type ia supernovae in combination with the changing transparency of the ejected material they produce the rapidly declining light curve core collapse supernovae are on average visually fainter than type ia supernovae but the total energy released is far higher in these type of supernovae the gravitational potential energy is converted into kinetic energy that compresses and collapses the core initially producing electron neutrinos from disintegrating nucleons followed by all flavours of thermal neutrinos from the super heated neutron star core around of these neutrinos are thought to deposit sufficient energy into the outer layers of the star to drive the resulting catastrophe but again the details cannot be reproduced exactly in current models kinetic energies and nickel yields are somewhat lower than type ia supernovae hence the lower peak visual luminosity of type II supernovae but energy from the de ionisation of the many solar masses of remaining hydrogen can contribute to a much slower decline in luminosity and produce the plateau phase seen in the majority of core collapse supernovae in some core collapse supernovae fallback onto a black hole drives relativistic jets which may produce a brief energetic and directional burst of gamma rays and also transfers substantial further energy into the ejected material this is one scenario for producing high luminosity supernovae and is thought to be the cause of type ic hypernovae and long duration gamma ray bursts if the relativistic jets are too brief and fail to penetrate the stellar envelope then a low luminosity gamma ray burst may be produced and the supernova may be sub luminous when a supernova occurs inside a small dense cloud of circumstellar material it will produce a shock wave that can efficiently convert a high fraction of the kinetic energy into electromagnetic radiation even though the initial energy was entirely normal the resulting supernova will have high luminosity and extended duration since it does not rely on exponential radioactive decay this type of event may cause type iin hypernovae although pair instability supernovae are core collapse supernovae with spectra and light curves similar to type II p the nature after core collapse is more like that of a giant type ia with runaway fusion of carbon oxygen and silicon the total energy released by the highest mass events is comparable to other core collapse supernovae but neutrino production is thought to be very low hence the kinetic and electromagnetic energy released is very high the cores of these stars are much larger than any white dwarf and the amount of radioactive nickel and other heavy elements ejected from their cores can be orders of magnitude higher with consequently high visual luminosity progenitor the supernova classification type is closely tied to the type of star at the time of the collapse the occurrence of each type of supernova depends dramatically on the metallicity and hence the age of the host galaxy type ia supernovae are produced from white dwarf stars in binary systems and occur in all galaxy types core collapse supernovae are only found in galaxies undergoing current or very recent star formation since they result from short lived massive stars they are most commonly found in type sc spirals but also in the arms of other spiral galaxies and in irregular galaxies especially starburst galaxies type ib c and II l and possibly most type iin supernovae are only thought to be produced from stars having near solar metallicity levels that result in high mass loss from massive stars hence they are less common in older more distant galaxies the table shows the progenitor for the main types of core collapse supernova and the approximate proportions that have been observed in the local neighbourhood there are a number of difficulties reconciling modelled and observed stellar evolution leading up to core collapse supernovae red supergiants are the progenitors for the vast majority of core collapse supernovae and these have been observed but only at relatively low masses and luminosities below about m and l respectively most progenitors of type II supernovae are not detected and must be considerably fainter and presumably less massive it is now proposed that higher mass red supergiants do not explode as supernovae but instead evolve back towards hotter temperatures several progenitors of type iib supernovae have been confirmed and these were k and g supergiants plus one a supergiant yellow hypergiants or lbvs are proposed progenitors for type iib supernovae and almost all type iib supernovae near enough to observe have shown such progenitors until just a few decades ago hot supergiants were not considered likely to explode but observations have shown otherwise blue supergiants form an unexpectedly high proportion of confirmed supernova progenitors partly due to their high luminosity and easy detection while not a single wolf rayet progenitor has yet been clearly identified models have had difficulty showing how blue supergiants lose enough mass to reach supernova without progressing to a different evolutionary stage one study has shown a possible route for low luminosity post red supergiant luminous blue variables to collapse most likely as a type iin supernova several examples of hot luminous progenitors of type iin supernovae have been detected SN gy and SN jl were both apparently massive luminous stars but are very distant and SN ip had a highly luminous progenitor likely to have been an LBV but is a peculiar supernova whose exact nature is disputed the progenitors of type ib c supernovae are not observed at all and constraints on their possible luminosity are often lower than those of known WC stars WO stars are extremely rare and visually relatively faint so it is difficult to say whether such progenitors are missing or just yet to be observed very luminous progenitors have not been securely identified despite numerous supernovae being observed near enough that such progenitors would have been clearly imaged population modelling shows that the observed type ib c supernovae could be reproduced by a mixture of single massive stars and stripped envelope stars from interacting binary systems the continued lack of unambiguous detection of progenitors for normal type ib and ic supernovae may be due to most massive stars collapsing directly to a black hole without a supernova outburst most of these supernovae are then produced from lower mass low luminosity helium stars in binary systems a small number would be from rapidly rotating massive stars likely corresponding to the highly energetic type ic BL events that are associated with long duration gamma ray bursts other impacts source of heavy elements supernovae are a major source of elements in the interstellar medium from oxygen through to rubidium though the theoretical abundances of the elements produced or seen in the spectra varies significantly depending on the various supernova types type ia supernovae produce mainly silicon and iron peak elements metals such as nickel and iron core collapse supernovae eject much smaller quantities of the iron peak elements than type ia supernovae but larger masses of light alpha elements such as oxygen and neon and elements heavier than zinc the latter is especially true with electron capture supernovae the bulk of the material ejected by type II supernovae is hydrogen and helium the heavy elements are produced by nuclear fusion for nuclei up to s silicon photodisintegration rearrangement and quasiequilibrium during silicon burning for nuclei between ar and ni and rapid capture of neutrons r process during the supernova s collapse for elements heavier than iron the r process produces highly unstable nuclei that are rich in neutrons and that rapidly beta decay into more stable forms in supernovae r process reactions are responsible for about half of all the isotopes of elements beyond iron although neutron star mergers may be the main astrophysical source for many of these elements in the modern universe old asymptotic giant branch AGB stars are the dominant source of dust from s process elements oxides and carbon however in the early universe before AGB stars formed supernovae may have been the main source of dust role in stellar evolution remnants of many supernovae consist of a compact object and a rapidly expanding shock wave of material this cloud of material sweeps up surrounding interstellar medium during a free expansion phase which can last for up to two centuries the wave then gradually undergoes a period of adiabatic expansion and will slowly cool and mix with the surrounding interstellar medium over a period of about years the big bang produced hydrogen helium and traces of lithium while all heavier elements are synthesised in stars and supernovae supernovae tend to enrich the surrounding interstellar medium with elements other than hydrogen and helium which usually astronomers refer to as metals these injected elements ultimately enrich the molecular clouds that are the sites of star formation thus each stellar generation has a slightly different composition going from an almost pure mixture of hydrogen and helium to a more metal rich composition supernovae are the dominant mechanism for distributing these heavier elements which are formed in a star during its period of nuclear fusion the different abundances of elements in the material that forms a star have important influences on the star s life and may decisively influence the possibility of having planets orbiting it the kinetic energy of an expanding supernova remnant can trigger star formation by compressing nearby dense molecular clouds in space the increase in turbulent pressure can also prevent star formation if the cloud is unable to lose the excess energy evidence from daughter products of short lived radioactive isotopes shows that a nearby supernova helped determine the composition of the solar system billion years ago and may even have triggered the formation of this system on june astronomers reported narrowing down the source of fast radio bursts frbs which may now plausibly include compact object mergers and magnetars arising from normal core collapse supernovae cosmic rays supernova remnants are thought to accelerate a large fraction of galactic primary cosmic rays but direct evidence for cosmic ray production has only been found in a small number of remnants gamma rays from pion decay have been detected from the supernova remnants IC and w these are produced when accelerated protons from the SNR impact on interstellar material gravitational waves supernovae are potentially strong galactic sources of gravitational waves but none have so far been detected the only gravitational wave events so far detected are from mergers of black holes and neutron stars probable remnants of supernovae effect on earth a near earth supernova is a supernova close enough to the earth to have noticeable effects on its biosphere depending upon the type and energy of the supernova it could be as far as light years away in it was theorised that traces of past supernovae might be detectable on earth in the form of metal isotope signatures in rock strata iron enrichment was later reported in deep sea rock of the pacific ocean in elevated levels of nitrate ions were found in antarctic ice which coincided with the and supernovae gamma rays from these supernovae could have boosted levels of nitrogen oxides which became trapped in the ice type ia supernovae are thought to be potentially the most dangerous if they occur close enough to the earth because these supernovae arise from dim common white dwarf stars in binary systems it is likely that a supernova that can affect the earth will occur unpredictably and in a star system that is not well studied the closest known candidate is IK pegasi see below recent estimates predict that a type II supernova would have to be closer than eight parsecs light years to destroy half of the earth s ozone layer and there are no such candidates closer than about light years milky way candidates the next supernova in the milky way will likely be detectable even if it occurs on the far side of the galaxy it is likely to be produced by the collapse of an unremarkable red supergiant and it is very probable that it will already have been catalogued in infrared surveys such as MASS there is a smaller chance that the next core collapse supernova will be produced by a different type of massive star such as a yellow hypergiant luminous blue variable or wolf rayet the chances of the next supernova being a type ia produced by a white dwarf are calculated to be about a third of those for a core collapse supernova again it should be observable wherever it occurs but it is less likely that the progenitor will ever have been observed it isn t even known exactly what a type ia progenitor system looks like and it is difficult to detect them beyond a few parsecs the total supernova rate in our galaxy is estimated to be between and per century although we haven t actually observed one for several centuries statistically the next supernova is likely to be produced from an otherwise unremarkable red supergiant but it is difficult to identify which of those supergiants are in the final stages of heavy element fusion in their cores and which have millions of years left the most massive red supergiants shed their atmospheres and evolve to wolf rayet stars before their cores collapse all wolf rayet stars end their lives from the wolf rayet phase within a million years or so but again it is difficult to identify those that are closest to core collapse one class that is expected to have no more than a few thousand years before exploding are the WO wolf rayet stars which are known to have exhausted their core helium only eight of them are known and only four of those are in the milky way a number of close or well known stars have been identified as possible core collapse supernova candidates the red supergiants antares and betelgeuse the yellow hypergiant rho cassiopeiae the luminous blue variable eta carinae that has already produced a supernova impostor and the brightest component a wolf rayet star in the regor or gamma velorum system others have gained notoriety as possible although not very likely progenitors for a gamma ray burst for example WR identification of candidates for a type ia supernova is much more speculative any binary with an accreting white dwarf might produce a supernova although the exact mechanism and timescale is still debated these systems are faint and difficult to identify but the novae and recurrent novae are such systems that conveniently advertise themselves one example is u scorpii the nearest known type ia supernova candidate is IK pegasi HR located at a distance of light years but observations suggest it will be several million years before the white dwarf can accrete the critical mass required to become a type ia supernova

supernova spatially coincident with galaxy CGCG approximately million ly million pc distant in the hercules constellation it was first detected on june by the ATLAS HKO telescope and had generated significant interest among astronomers throughout the world later on july and after AT cow had significantly faded astronomers based on follow up studies with the nordic optical telescope NOT formally described AT cow as SN cow a type ib supernova showing an unprecedented spectrum for a supernova of this class although others mostly at first but also more recently have referred to it as a type ic BL supernova an explanation to help better understand the unique features of AT cow has been presented AT cow is one of the few reported fast blue optical transients fbots observed in the universe in may however a much more powerful FBOT than AT cow namely CRTS CSS j or CSS for short was reportedly observed on november two independent teams of astronomers both concluded that the AT cow event was either a newly formed black hole in the process of accreting matter or the frenetic rotation of a neutron star in january astronomers proposed that the explosion may have been a white dwarf being pulled apart by a black hole or a supernova leaving behind a black hole or a neutron star the creation of a compact body being observed for the first time history AT cow was first detected on june at UTC by the ATLAS HKO telescope a twin m in system at the haleakala observatory in hawaii it was a powerful astronomical explosion discovery magnitude redshift times brighter than a normal supernova spatially coincident with galaxy CGCG approximately million ly million pc distant in the hercules constellation by june this transient astronomical event had generated significant interest among astronomers throughout the world at least major telescopes were observing the event the largest number as of june of concurrent observations over posted on june of any astronomical event ever reported on the astronomer s telegram the event had been tentatively identified as a supernova and given the designation supernova cow and classification SN ic BL the first x ray and ultraviolet UV observations of AT cow were obtained on june with the swift telescope these observations revealed that the object was a bright x ray UV transient with an x ray luminosity of erg s and a UV brightness of about vega mag in the range å on june astronomers using the m in liverpool telescope and the m in telescope at palomar observatory noted on the astronomer s telegram AT cow has faded every night since our first observations june the reported observations suggest that although a link to ic BL sne and grbs remains credible given the smooth spectra and luminous radio and x ray counterpart s AT cow is distinct in other ways and its true identity remains unclear observations are continuing on june astronomers using m in telescopes at the beijing astronomical observatory reported further support for the fading of AT cow however using the swift XRT telescope on june an increase in the x ray luminosity of the transient was reported that would be the beginning of an unusual x ray variable behavior on july astronomers using the fermi large area telescope LAT reported that there were no significant mev gamma ray emissions between june further on july astronomers reported using the cadmium zinc telluride imager CZTI detector aboard the astrosat space observatory no hard x ray transients were detected between june event detection time and using the UVIT fitted with a f m filter observed an AB magnitude of an estimated at the AT cow location on july moreover astronomers on july reported using the MAXI GSC detector aboard the ISS that no significant x ray emissions were detected between june on july astronomers using nustar reported a lessening of hard x ray emissions from AT cow on july astronomers using integral reported no detections of the source from june july however GRB like bursts may have been observed earlier in the vicinity on and june although association of these bursts with AT cow may be disfavored radio emissions at ghz with a flux density of microjy were detected from the location of AT cow on july by e MERLIN radio emissions at the AT cow location were detected by ATCA at ghz with mjy flux density and at ghz with mjy on july and at ghz with mjy on july VLBI observations at ghz with the NRAO using the VLBA and effelsberg radio telescopes found a total flux density of mjy around july at a reportedly more accurate but consistent within uncertainties astrometric location of AT cow RA h m s DEC d than that of e MERLIN on july astronomers based on follow up studies with the m in nordic optical telescope NOT formally described AT cow as SN cow and as a type ib supernova showing an unprecedented spectrum for a supernova of this class on july astronomers using the m in kanata telescope at the higashi hiroshima observatory observed further declines in the optical and near infrared luminosity of the AT cow position in early july and noted that the large decline rates of the light curves were quite large compared to type ic ic BL and type ib c supernovae on august ultraviolet observations of the AT cow location using the wide field camera WFC on the hubble space telescope HST detected brightness vega mag of about on all four bands f w f w f w f w studied on august astronomers at the giant metrewave radio telescope GMRT detected a low frequency radio emission mhz band ujy at the AT cow position on august astronomers using the high energy stereoscopic system HESS array of cherenkov telescopes CTA reported no significant gamma ray source at the AT cow location on july which as a consequence resulted in the preliminary determination of upper limits on the integrated flux of the very high energy VHE gamma emission from AT cow as follows above the energy threshold gev sd an upper limit of e ph cm s above tev sd an upper limit of e ph cm s properties according to astronomers at the time of its discovery the explosion with a surface temperature of over c f k and traveling km s mi s may have been a cataclysmic variable star CV gamma ray burst GRB gravitational wave GW supernova SN or something else however the CV scenario was rapidly disfavored given the initial featureless optical spectrum and the large initial x ray luminosity of the transient according to astronomer kate maguire of queen s university belfast it really just appeared out of nowhere there are other objects that have been discovered that are as fast but the fastness and the brightness that s quite unusual the classification of type ic BL indicates a spectrum with very unusually broad lines but with no hydrogen lines and weak or missing helium lines such a spectrum is produced by the explosion of a very large star which has lost its outer layers of hydrogen and helium however according to astronomer shubham srivastav associated with the m in himalayan chandra telescope HCT although spectroscopic features indicate a tentative similarity with broad line ic supernovae its true nature remains a puzzle also according to maguire we re not sure yet what it is but the normal powering mechanism for a supernova is radioactive decay of nickel and this event is too bright and too fast for that the AT cow explosion could have been accompanied by a GW emission but the GW emission could not be detected since the LIGO detectors in the states of washington and louisiana were down at the time of the event due to service upgradings an explanation to help better understand the unique features of AT cow particularly as a white dwarf tidal disruption event has been presented as of september AT cow has been explained in various ways including as a type ic supernova a gamma ray burst an interaction between a white dwarf and black hole and as a magnetar preliminary studies to better understand the exact physical nature of AT cow using the european VLBI network EVN have been presented on november two independent teams of astronomers both concluded that the AT cow event was either a newly formed black hole in the process of accreting matter or the frenetic rotation of a neutron star in january anna ho of the california institute of technology in pasadena who conducted observations with the submillimeter array on mauna kea in hawaii noted that an unusually protracted period of continuing activity after the event was noticed enabled more extensive study than typically afforded during such events allowing observation of it while it was brightening subsequently astronomers proposed that AT cow may have been a white dwarf being pulled apart by a black hole or a supernova leaving behind a black hole or a

There are many approaches to finding semantically similar terms, including by using topic language models, pointwise mutual information, and word embedding. Among these, word embedding represents the current state-of-the-art in term clustering, and we will hence focus on word embedding for the remainder of this lab assignment.\n",

Conceptually, this is very similar to representing documents as vectors in that each vector represents the word's location in a multidimensional space. Vector representations for each word are learned using a neural network, and the resulting vector locations have meaning relative to one another. Specifically, vectors of semantically similar words are closer to each other (in terms of cosine distance) than vectors for semantically dissimilar words. Google’s famous word embedding implementation is called **word2vec**, which we will be using in this assignment.\n",
